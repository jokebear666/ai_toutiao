The authors develop PINNBARDS, a Physics-Informed Neural Network that uses observed toroidal band patterns and the governing MHD equations to reconstruct the necessary initial state-vector for the tachocline. Their analysis identifies optimal physical parameters (20-30 kG field strength) that best match observations, providing a novel pathway for weeks-ahead solar activity prediction.",

Proposes EssayCBM, a rubric-aligned framework that uses dedicated prediction heads to evaluate specific writing concepts (e.g., Thesis Clarity, Evidence Use) instead of predicting grades directly from text. 2. Introduces a transparent bottleneck where a lightweight network computes the final grade using only the concept scores, enabling interpretability and human-in-the-loop adjustments. 3. Demonstrates that the system matches black-box performance while providing actionable, concept-level feedback through an intuitive web interface.",
          "summary": "The paper addresses the lack of transparency in automated essay grading systems by introducing EssayCBM, a framework that first predicts scores for specific writing concepts aligned with a rubric and then uses these scores to compute a final grade. This approach provides interpretable, concept-level feedback and allows instructors to adjust predictions in a human-in-the-loop manner. The proposed method achieves performance comparable to black-box models while offering greater accountability and actionable insights for educators and students.",

The method exploits the agent's semantic imitation heuristic through a poisoned RAG store, leading to persistent behavioral compromise. The authors demonstrate that this attack can cause significant and stealthy behavioral drift in agents like MetaGPT's DataInterpreter.",

The study finds that lower-precision PTQ (e.g., 4-bit, 2-bit, 1.58-bit) significantly reduces privacy leakage, offering up to an order of magnitude less vulnerability compared to full-precision models, though at the cost of decreased utility. The results provide practical insights for balancing efficiency, accuracy, and privacy in model deployment.",

Provides an insider, autoethnographic account of the sociotechnical friction and \"invisible labour\" required to make enterprise GenAI functional in higher education. 2. Applies and extends Alter's theory of workarounds to interpret user-driven adaptations as integral acts of sociotechnical integration, not mere deviations. 3. Highlights the central paradox of GenAI workarounds: they enable functionality but can create unofficial \"shadow\" systems and obscure the crucial, politically charged labour involved.",
          "summary": "This study uses analytic autoethnography to examine a workaround developed when an institutional goal of empowering staff with GenAI clashed with technical and political constraints. It argues such workarounds are essential acts of sociotechnical integration that reveal the \"invisible labour\" needed to make AI functional, but this labour is often obscured, creating a paradox. The findings position this invisible labour as a core, rather than peripheral, component of practical GenAI implementation.",

Experiments show this approach can deterministically reject high-probability yet structurally disconnected hallucinations, serving as a sanity check for generative reasoning.",

It achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks by enabling low-latency, interpretable video recommendation without handcrafted labels. The approach demonstrates that leveraging VLLM priors and visual reasoning through layer-wise fusion is effective for downstream vision tasks.",
