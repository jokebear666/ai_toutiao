      "summary": "This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based optimization framework using surrogate models (Gaussian processes and multi-layer perceptrons) to minimize the levelized cost of electricity for a heat-pipe microreactor design. The method successfully reduces costs by over 57% by adjusting design parameters while satisfying key physical and safety constraints. The main cost drivers identified are operation and maintenance costs, capital costs, and specifically the costs of axial reflectors and control drum materials.",
