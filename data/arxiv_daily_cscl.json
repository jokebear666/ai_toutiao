Identifies and names the \"stealth slip\" phenomenon, where conversational preambles can rotate activations into subspaces undetectable by linear probes, and shows that training-time feature ablation, not prompting, is required to address the issue.",

Through behavioral experiments and sparse autoencoder analysis, it finds that models learn statistical co-occurrences rather than pragmatic intent, due to overlapping latent features for description and action.

Revealed notable cross-lingual differences in attack effectiveness, with Arabic injections having minimal impact compared to others.",
      "summary": "This paper investigates the vulnerability of LLM-based academic peer review systems to hidden prompt injection attacks. By injecting adversarial instructions in four languages into a dataset of real papers and having an LLM review them, the authors found that such attacks can substantially change review outcomes for English, Japanese, and Chinese, but not Arabic. The results highlight a critical security risk and language-dependent susceptibility in automated reviewing pipelines.",

This redefinition of traversability allows for more efficient navigation planning in obstructed environments.

      "summary": "This paper introduces Activation Oracles, models trained using the LatentQA approach to answer natural language questions about the internal activations of other LLMs. The core finding is that these oracles, especially when trained on diverse datasets, can generalize to out-of-distribution tasks and effectively verbalize hidden information, such as knowledge from fine-tuning, often matching or exceeding prior white-box interpretability methods.",

      "summary": "This paper proposes Predictive Concept Decoders (PCDs), an end-to-end trained architecture where an encoder compresses a model's internal activations into a sparse list of concepts, and a decoder uses this list to answer questions about the model's behavior. The method is pretrained on large datasets and then finetuned, showing that the interpretability and downstream performance of the bottleneck concepts improve with more data.",
