      "summary": "The paper proposes Struct-SQL, a knowledge distillation framework that trains a small language model using a structured chain-of-thought derived from query execution plans, rather than unstructured reasoning traces. The distilled model achieves an 8.1% absolute improvement over an unstructured baseline, primarily due to a reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that structured logical blueprints are beneficial for reliable SQL generation in small models.",

It uses a query-aware LLM encoder, a graph transformer over functional dependencies, and a Steiner-tree heuristic to select a relevant, connectivity-preserving sub-schema. The method achieves high recall and precision while maintaining low latency and scaling to schemas with over 23,000 columns.",
