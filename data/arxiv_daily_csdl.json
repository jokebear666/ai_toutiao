Discovered a non-linear (inverted U-shape) relationship between gender diversity and team impact for both leadership and support groups. 3. Revealed the moderating effect of team size, showing that the impact of leadership-group gender diversity shifts from negative to positive as team size increases, while support-group diversity remains consistently positive.",
      "summary": "This study investigates how gender diversity within specific team roles (leadership vs. support) affects scientific team impact, measured by citations. By analyzing over 130,000 PLOS papers and using contribution statements to define roles, the authors employed multivariable and threshold regression. They found the relationship is an inverted U-shape, identified high-impact team compositions, and showed that team size significantly moderates the effect of leadership diversity.",

Advanced the methodological field by employing beta regression to model citation percentiles, appropriately handling the bounded nature of citation data. 3. Demonstrated that team-level centrality aggregation, particularly through exponentially weighted summation, explains citation variance more effectively than individual or rank-based approaches, highlighting the importance of collective network connectivity.",

It proposes a new centrality metric (HCTCD) and uses beta regression to analyze data from NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR. The findings show that long-term network centrality, especially at the team level, is a strong predictor of citations, challenging evaluation paradigms that focus solely on content.",
