      "contributions": "1. Proposes Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm using Functors, Applicatives, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for AI agent design. 2. Demonstrates how Monads and Applicatives manage sequential composition and parallel execution, and how Monad Transformers enable systematic composition of capabilities like state and error handling. 3. Extends the MCE framework to describe Meta-Agents for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows via metaprogramming.",
      "summary": "This paper addresses the brittleness and complexity in current AI agent architectures by introducing Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a paradigm that leverages algebraic structures like Monads to formally manage state, errors, and concurrency within agent workflows. The proposed method enables the construction of complex, resilient agents from simple, verifiable components and is extended to support generative orchestration via Meta-Agents. The work concludes that MCE provides a principled foundation for building robust and scalable autonomous agent systems.",
