      "contributions": "1. Presents SPUMA, a full GPU porting of OpenFOAM targeting both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. 2. Implements a portable programming model with a memory pool manager leveraging unified memory for efficient GPU utilization. 3. Demonstrates significant performance and energy efficiency gains through extensive testing on pre-exascale clusters, showing up to 82% energy reduction compared to CPU simulations.",
      "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of GPU programmability for open-source CFD by introducing SPUMA, a portable GPU port of OpenFOAM that uses a memory pool manager with unified memory. The method was tested on LUMI and Leonardo clusters, showing strong scalability up to 65% efficiency and weak scalability up to 85%, while reducing energy consumption by up to 82% compared to CPU-based simulations.",

      "contributions": "1. Identified a new statistical failure in the widely-used MT19937 PRNG using a natural run-length distribution test. 2. Provided a mathematical theorem explaining the observed anomalies, linking them to the sparseness of a specific matrix in the generator's recursion. 3. Demonstrated that while the defect is theoretically significant, detecting it in practice requires an astronomical number of samples, thus assessing its practical severity.",
      "summary": "This paper reports a new statistical flaw in the Mersenne Twister MT19937 pseudorandom number generator, where the distribution of run-lengths for identical 32-bit integers shows a significant anomaly (e.g., run-length 623 appears ~40 times more than expected). The authors mathematically analyze and prove that this failure is caused by the sparseness of a specific matrix in the generator's recurrence. They conclude that while this is a theoretical defect, its practical impact is minimal due to the extreme difficulty of detection.",
