      "contributions": "1. Introduced an adaptive thresholding method for eye-tracking data that uses a Markovian model to find the optimal threshold by minimizing state transitions (K-ratio). 2. Systematically evaluated and compared the noise robustness of three common threshold-based algorithms (velocity, angular velocity, dispersion) with and without the adaptive optimization. 3. Provided practical guidance for algorithm selection, showing that while velocity thresholds have high baseline accuracy, adaptive dispersion thresholds offer superior robustness to high noise levels.",
      "summary": "This paper addresses the problem of distinguishing fixations from saccades in noisy eye-tracking data, where fixed thresholds can introduce bias. The authors propose an adaptive thresholding method that models gaze dynamics as a Markov process and optimizes the threshold to minimize state transitions. Their evaluation shows that adaptive thresholds, especially for dispersion-based algorithms, significantly improve classification robustness under high noise conditions compared to fixed-threshold baselines.",
