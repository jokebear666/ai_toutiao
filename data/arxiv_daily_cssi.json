      "summary": "This paper presents an efficient Bayesian algorithm to jointly infer both the latent strengths of objects and the unknown function mapping strengths to win probabilities from pairwise comparison data. The method uses Chebyshev-based and neural network approaches to model this function without prior assumptions. Experimental results show robustness across model specifications and improved predictive accuracy, such as overcoming bookmaker profit margins in tennis data.",
