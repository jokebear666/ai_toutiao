  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper studies the Gathering problem for oblivious robots moving on vertex- and edge-transitive graphs under round-robin scheduling without multiplicity detection. The authors develop time-optimal algorithms for specific topologies like infinite grids and hypercubes that exploit their structural properties. They conclude that no general algorithm likely exists for all solvable cases due to the heavy reliance on specific topological characteristics.

  - **tags:** [mlsys], [cluster infrastructure], [constraint programming, pod packing, OR-Tools, Kubernetes scheduler]
  - **authors:** Henrik Daniel Christensen, Saverio Giallorenzo, Jacopo Mauro
  - **institution:** University of Southern Denmark, University of Bologna
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.08373
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes using constraint programming with OR-Tools to optimize Kubernetes pod scheduling by finding optimal allocations that satisfy priorities and resource requirements. As a plugin to the default scheduler, this approach significantly improves pod placement in scenarios where the default scheduler fails, achieving better allocations for higher-priority pods within practical time windows while certifying optimality when possible.
