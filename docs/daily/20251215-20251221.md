  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper establishes a formal bijection between autoregressive language models (ARMs) and energy-based models (EBMs) in function space, showing this equivalence corresponds to a special case of the soft Bellman equation in maximum entropy RL. It demonstrates the equivalence of their supervised learning and provides theoretical error bounds for distilling an EBM into an ARM. The results explain how ARMs, despite being trained on next-token prediction, can implicitly perform lookahead planning.
