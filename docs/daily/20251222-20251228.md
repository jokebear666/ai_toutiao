- **[arXiv251225] PHOTON: Hierarchical Autoregressive Modeling for Lightspeed and Memory-Efficient Language Generation**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [hierarchical autoregressive model, KV-cache optimization, memory-bound inference, multi-resolution context, throughput-quality trade-off]
  - **authors:** Yuma Ichikawa, Naoya Takagi, Takumi Nakagawa, Yuzi Kanazawa, Akira Sakai
  - **institution:** Fujitsu Limited, RIKEN Center for AIP, Institute of Science Tokyo, Tokai University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20687
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes PHOTON, a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces the Transformer's flat token-by-token scanning with a vertical, multi-resolution context access pattern. 2. Introduces a persistent hierarchy of latent streams, with a bottom-up encoder compressing tokens and lightweight top-down decoders reconstructing token representations, reducing decode-time KV-cache traffic. 3. Demonstrates significant improvements in throughput per unit memory (up to 10^3x) and advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks compared to Transformer-based models.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper identifies that Transformer inference becomes memory-bound due to ever-growing KV-cache reads/writes during autoregressive decoding. To solve this, it proposes PHOTON, a hierarchical model that accesses context vertically at multiple resolutions instead of scanning tokens horizontally. This architectural change drastically reduces memory traffic, yielding orders-of-magnitude higher throughput per unit memory while maintaining quality.

  - **contributions:** 1. Provides a systematic survey of the state-of-the-art in Speedy Secure Finality (SSF) protocols, tracing their evolution from foundational works like Goldfish to RLMD-GHOST. 2. Introduces and explains core theoretical primitives for understanding SSF, such as reorganization resilience and the generalized sleepy model. 3. Analyzes the practical trade-offs of Single Slot Finality and surveys the 3-Slot Finality (3SF) protocol as a pragmatic solution balancing fast finality with Ethereum's engineering constraints.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper surveys research on Speedy Secure Finality (SSF) to reduce the long confirmation latency in Ethereum's Gasper protocol. It reviews the evolution of fast finality protocols, analyzes their design trade-offs, and highlights the 3-Slot Finality protocol as a practical synthesis. The main conclusion is that 3SF offers a viable path to achieve faster, secure finality while addressing the network's practical limitations.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20760
  - **contributions:** 1. Provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization using causal inference as a structured testbed, examining generalization across query levels and structural complexity. 2. Identifies that RLVR's benefits over SFT for generalization are contingent on specific combinations of model size and training query level, and depend on the model's initial reasoning competence. 3. Shows that RLVR improves specific causal reasoning subskills, such as marginalization strategy and intermediate probability calculation, leading to accuracy gains on complex queries.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper studies the generalization of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language models on causal reasoning tasks. It finds that RLVR can outperform supervised fine-tuning in generalization, but its effectiveness depends on model size, training data, and the model's initial competence. The results indicate RLVR improves specific reasoning sub-skills when the model has a sufficient foundational ability.
