  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a two-level hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework for joint link selection and trajectory optimization in UAV mobility management within SAGIN. The method uses a top-level DDQN for discrete link selection and a lower-level constrained SAC with Lagrangian multipliers for continuous trajectory optimization under QoS constraints. Simulation results show the proposed scheme outperforms benchmarks in throughput, link switching frequency, and QoS satisfaction.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes improved meta-learners for few-shot, weakly-supervised segmentation of the optic disc and cup in fundus images. The core method introduces Omni meta-training for balanced data usage and efficient versions to reduce computational costs, along with sparsification techniques for generating scribbles. The best model, EO-ProtoSeg, achieves high segmentation accuracy using only one sparsely labeled image, outperforming methods that require more labels and being comparable to heavier unsupervised domain adaptation approaches.
