- **[arXiv251222] Navigating Taxonomic Expansions of Entity Sets Driven by Knowledge Bases**
  - **tags:** [ai], [knowledge representation and reasoning], [entity set expansion, expansion graph, logical formula, semantic inclusion, computational complexity]
  - **authors:** Pietro Cofone, Giovanni Amendola, Marco Manna, Aldo Ricioppo
  - **institution:** University of Calabria, University of Cyprus
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16953
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a logic-based framework using expansion graphs, which are rooted directed acyclic graphs, to support taxonomic expansions of entity sets from knowledge bases. To avoid the impracticality of fully materializing these potentially large graphs, the authors formalize efficient reasoning tasks to check relationships between entity tuples within the graph structure. Their main conclusion is that, under realistic assumptions like bounded input, these tasks can be implemented efficiently, enabling local and incremental navigation without full graph construction.

- **[arXiv251222] Lights, Camera, Consistency: A Multistage Pipeline for Character-Stable AI Video Stories**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [multi-modal inference], [visual anchoring, asset-first mechanism, temporal bridge, diffusion models, large language model (LLM), text-to-video (T2V), character consistency, multi-stage pipeline]
  - **authors:** Chayan Jain, Rishant Sharma, Archit Garg, Ishan Bhanuka, Pratik Narang, Dhruv Kumar
  - **institution:** BITS Pilani
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16954
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a multi-stage pipeline for generating long, character-consistent video stories. It uses an LLM to create a script, a text-to-image model to design consistent character visuals as anchors, and a video generation model to synthesize scenes individually, with a temporal bridge linking them. The method's necessity is validated by showing that removing visual anchoring causes a catastrophic drop in character consistency, and cultural biases in current models are also analyzed.

- **[arXiv251222] Enhancing Tree Species Classification: Insights from YOLOv8 and Explainable AI Applied to TLS Point Cloud Projections**
  - **tags:** [ai], [computer vision], [YOLOv8, Finer-CAM, saliency maps, cross-validation, TLS point cloud projections]
  - **authors:** Adrian Straker, Paul Magdon, Marco Zullich, Maximilian Freudenberg, Christoph Kleinn, Johannes Breidenbach, Stefano Puliti, Nils Nölke
  - **institution:** University of Applied Sciences and Art (HAWK), University of Groningen, University of Göttingen, Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO)
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16950
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a novel method that links Finer-CAM explanations to structural segments in TLS point cloud projections to evaluate which features drive tree species classification using YOLOv8 models. The analysis of saliency maps reveals that models primarily rely on crown features for classification, with stem features being more important for certain species, and that the models' perception of species similarity aligns with human expert judgment. The results underscore the need for explainable AI to understand model decision processes and build confidence in predictions.

  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [retrieval-augmented generation, long-term memory, semantic imitation, indirect injection attack, memory poisoning, MetaGPT, DataInterpreter]
  - **authors:** Saksham Sahai Srivastava, Haoyu He
  - **institution:** University of Georgia
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16962

The method exploits the agent's semantic imitation heuristic through a poisoned RAG store, leading to persistent behavioral compromise. The authors demonstrate that this attack can cause significant and stealthy behavioral drift in agents like MetaGPT's DataInterpreter.

The distilled model achieves an 8.1% absolute improvement over an unstructured baseline, primarily due to a reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that structured logical blueprints are beneficial for reliable SQL generation in small models.

- **[arXiv251222] When F1 Fails: Granularity-Aware Evaluation for Dialogue Topic Segmentation**
  - **tags:** [ai], [dialogue topic segmentation], [window-tolerant F1, boundary density, segment coherence, granularity-aware evaluation]
  - **authors:** Michael H. Coen
  - **institution:** Independent Researcher
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17083
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces a new evaluation framework for dialogue topic segmentation that emphasizes boundary density and segment coherence alongside window-tolerant F1. It demonstrates through cross-dataset experiments that reported performance differences are often artifacts of annotation granularity mismatches, not model quality. The core conclusion is that topic segmentation should be viewed as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set.

The method, applied to Mini-ARC tasks, produces uncertainty-aware predictions by spreading probability across multiple hypotheses, contrasting with Bayesian Model Averaging which tends to concentrate weight on a single candidate. The results highlight the value of algorithmic information-theoretic priors for robust, interpretable reasoning under uncertainty.
