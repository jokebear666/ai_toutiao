  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents AIE4ML, an end-to-end framework that automatically compiles neural networks into optimized firmware for AMD's AI Engine-ML accelerators. It achieves high efficiency through a structured parallelization method that scales across the 2D fabric and uses a novel graph placement algorithm for on-chip execution. The framework delivers GPU-class throughput with microsecond latency, making it suitable for ultra-low-latency applications like particle physics trigger systems.
