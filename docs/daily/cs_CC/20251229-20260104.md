- **[arXiv251229] A Note on the NP-Hardness of PARTITION Via First-Order Projections**
  - **tags:** [other], [computational complexity theory], [NP-hardness, first-order reductions, AC0 reductions, PARTITION problem, descriptive complexity]
  - **authors:** Paúl Risco Iturralde
  - **institution:** Independent researcher
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21448
  - **contributions:** 1. Demonstrates NP-hardness of the PARTITION problem via first-order projections, 2. Overcomes the obstacle of requiring large sums in the standard reduction by using descriptive complexity techniques, 3. Fills a gap in the literature regarding the hardness of PARTITION under restricted reductions like AC0.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This note addresses the open question of whether the PARTITION problem is NP-hard under restricted reductions like AC0. It modifies classic reductions from 3SAT to SUBSET-SUM to PARTITION, defining them using first-order logical formulas (first-order projections). The main conclusion is that PARTITION is indeed NP-hard via first-order projections, which implies hardness under polynomial-size AC0 reductions, thereby resolving the gap mentioned in prior work.

  - **tags:** [other], [computational complexity theory], [Range Avoidance Problem, Minimal Circuit Size Problem, AM ∩ coAM, Turing reductions]
  - **authors:** Edward A. Hirsch, Ilya Volkovich
  - **institution:** Ariel University, Boston College
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21764
  - **contributions:** 1. Presents an alternative approach to a known result linking languages reducible to the Range Avoidance Problem (Avoid) to the complexity class AM ∩ coAM. 2. Proposes using the Minimal Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) as a potential avenue to derive this containment result. 3. Highlights the connection between two central problems in complexity theory (Avoid and MCSP) for understanding the power of reductions.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This note explores the complexity of the Range Avoidance Problem (Avoid). It proposes a new potential method, using the Minimal Circuit Size Problem (MCSP), to show that any language reducible to Avoid via deterministic or randomized Turing reductions is contained in the complexity class AM ∩ coAM, offering an alternative to a recent proof.

- **[arXiv251229] Conserved active information**
  - **tags:** [ai], [information theory], [conserved active information, No-Free-Lunch, KL divergence, search space, information conservation]
  - **authors:** Yanchen Chen, Daniel Andrés Díaz-Pachón
  - **institution:** University of Miami
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21834
  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces conserved active information (I⊕), a symmetric measure of net information gain/loss across a search space that respects No-Free-Lunch conservation. 2. Demonstrates that I⊕ can reveal regimes (e.g., strong knowledge reducing global disorder) that are hidden from traditional measures like KL divergence. 3. Applies the framework to resolve a longstanding critique of active information and illustrates its utility in domains like Markov chains and cosmological fine-tuning.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a new information-theoretic measure called conserved active information (I⊕) to quantify net information change in search problems while respecting conservation laws. It shows that I⊕ uncovers scenarios, such as strong knowledge imposing order, which are missed by standard divergence measures. The work resolves a key critique of active information and enables applications in search and optimization.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21922
  - **contributions:** 1. Generalizing Poincaré duality from manifolds to sheaf-based classical and quantum codes, establishing a rigorous duality relationship between chain and cochain complexes. 2. Constructing multiplicative structures (cup and cap products) on sheaved chain complexes, leading to an explicit isomorphism between (co)homology groups. 3. Applying the framework to obtain transversal logical gates (CZ, CCZ, higher-order controlled-Z) on families of good qLDPC and quantum locally testable codes, pointing towards fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper generalizes Poincaré duality and multiplicative structures from topology to sheaf-based quantum codes. The authors rigorously prove duality relationships and construct cup/cap products, leading to an isomorphism between homology groups. As an application, they demonstrate how to construct transversal logical non-Clifford gates on good quantum LDPC codes, advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing.
