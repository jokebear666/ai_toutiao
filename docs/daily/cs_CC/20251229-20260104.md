- **[arXiv251229] A Note on the NP-Hardness of PARTITION Via First-Order Projections**
  - **tags:** [other], [computational complexity theory], [NP-hardness, first-order reductions, AC0 reductions, PARTITION problem, descriptive complexity]
  - **authors:** Paúl Risco Iturralde
  - **institution:** Independent researcher
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21448
  - **contributions:** 1. Demonstrates NP-hardness of the PARTITION problem via first-order projections, 2. Overcomes the obstacle of requiring large sums in the standard reduction by using descriptive complexity techniques, 3. Fills a gap in the literature regarding the hardness of PARTITION under restricted reductions like AC0.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This note addresses the open question of whether the PARTITION problem is NP-hard under restricted reductions like AC0. It modifies classic reductions from 3SAT to SUBSET-SUM to PARTITION, defining them using first-order logical formulas (first-order projections). The main conclusion is that PARTITION is indeed NP-hard via first-order projections, which implies hardness under polynomial-size AC0 reductions, thereby resolving the gap mentioned in prior work.

  - **authors:** Yanchen Chen, Daniel Andrés Díaz-Pachón
  - **institution:** University of Miami
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21834
  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces conserved active information (I⊕), a symmetric measure of net information gain/loss across a search space that respects No-Free-Lunch conservation. 2. Demonstrates that I⊕ can reveal regimes (e.g., strong knowledge reducing global disorder) that are hidden from traditional measures like KL divergence. 3. Applies the framework to resolve a longstanding critique of active information and illustrates its utility in domains like Markov chains and cosmological fine-tuning.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a new information-theoretic measure called conserved active information (I⊕) to quantify net information change in search problems while respecting conservation laws. It shows that I⊕ uncovers scenarios, such as strong knowledge imposing order, which are missed by standard divergence measures. The work resolves a key critique of active information and enables applications in search and optimization.

  - **authors:** Kacper Kluk, Jesper Nederlof
  - **institution:** University of Warsaw, Utrecht University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23121
  - **contributions:** 1. Proves unconditional lower bounds on the size of tropical circuits (modeling pure dynamic programming) for solving connectivity problems like TSP on graphs of bounded pathwidth. 2. Establishes a connection between tropical circuit complexity and the nondeterministic communication complexity of compatibility matrices. 3. Shows that any tropical circuit for TSP on a certain graph of pathwidth k requires at least 2^Ω(k log log k) gates, which is higher than known algebraic algorithms, suggesting algebra is necessary for competitive worst-case times.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper studies the limitations of pure dynamic programming, modeled by tropical circuits, for solving connectivity problems like the Traveling Salesperson Problem on graphs with small pathwidth. It proves an unconditional lower bound of 2^Ω(k log log k) gates for any tropical circuit solving TSP on a specific graph of pathwidth k. This result, established via a link to communication complexity, suggests that algebraic techniques are unavoidable for achieving the fastest known worst-case running times for these problems.
