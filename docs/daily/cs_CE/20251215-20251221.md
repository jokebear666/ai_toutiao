  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a method for applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to numerical data in cementitious materials research by converting tabular data into graph representations using the k-nearest neighbor approach. The study systematically optimizes model hyperparameters and feature selection, finding that the GNN's performance is comparable to a benchmark random forest model. The work establishes a foundational roadmap for transitioning to advanced, multi-modal, and physics-informed AI architectures for material design.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15083
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces Neural Modular Physics (NMP), a method that decomposes elastic dynamics into physically meaningful neural modules connected by intermediate physical quantities, combining neural network approximation with traditional simulator reliability. It demonstrates superior generalization, long-horizon stability, and better preservation of physical properties compared to monolithic neural simulators.

- **[arXiv251218] HD-Prot: A Protein Language Model for Joint Sequence-Structure Modeling with Continuous Structure Tokens**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [multi-modal training], [hybrid diffusion, continuous tokens, joint sequence-structure modeling, absorbing diffusion process, categorical prediction, continuous diffusion]

  - **institution:** The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, BioGen AI, Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15133
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes HD-Prot, a hybrid diffusion protein language model that integrates continuous structural tokens with discrete sequence tokens for joint modeling. It uses a unified absorbing diffusion process to handle both modalities, performing categorical prediction for sequences and continuous diffusion for structures. The model achieves competitive performance in tasks like co-generation and structure prediction, demonstrating the viability of combining categorical and continuous distributions in a unified architecture.

- **[arXiv251219] Techno-economic optimization of a heat-pipe microreactor, part I: theory and cost optimization**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [reinforcement learning, Gaussian processes, multi-layer perceptrons, surrogate models, levelized cost of electricity, techno-economic analysis]
  - **authors:** Paul Seurin, Dean Price, Luis Nunez
  - **institution:** Idaho National Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16032
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based optimization framework using surrogate models (Gaussian processes and multi-layer perceptrons) to minimize the levelized cost of electricity for a heat-pipe microreactor design. The method successfully reduces costs by over 57% by adjusting design parameters while satisfying key physical and safety constraints. The main cost drivers identified are operation and maintenance costs, capital costs, and specifically the costs of axial reflectors and control drum materials.

- **[arXiv251219] CauSTream: Causal Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning for Streamflow Forecasting**
  - **tags:** [ai], [causal representation learning], [causal spatio-temporal learning, causal discovery, directed acyclic graph, streamflow forecasting, hydrological modeling]

  - **institution:** Arizona State University, Tulane University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16046
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes CauSTream, a framework that jointly learns a causal graph for meteorological forcings and a spatio-temporal routing graph for streamflow forecasting. It establishes identifiability conditions for these structures and demonstrates that the model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially for longer forecast horizons, while providing interpretable causal graphs aligned with domain knowledge.
