  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a method for applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to numerical data in cementitious materials research by converting tabular data into graph representations using the k-nearest neighbor approach. The study systematically optimizes model hyperparameters and feature selection, finding that the GNN's performance is comparable to a benchmark random forest model. The work establishes a foundational roadmap for transitioning to advanced, multi-modal, and physics-informed AI architectures for material design.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15083
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces Neural Modular Physics (NMP), a method that decomposes elastic dynamics into physically meaningful neural modules connected by intermediate physical quantities, combining neural network approximation with traditional simulator reliability. It demonstrates superior generalization, long-horizon stability, and better preservation of physical properties compared to monolithic neural simulators.

- **[arXiv251218] HD-Prot: A Protein Language Model for Joint Sequence-Structure Modeling with Continuous Structure Tokens**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [multi-modal training], [hybrid diffusion, continuous tokens, joint sequence-structure modeling, absorbing diffusion process, categorical prediction, continuous diffusion]

  - **institution:** The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, BioGen AI, Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15133
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes HD-Prot, a hybrid diffusion protein language model that integrates continuous structural tokens with discrete sequence tokens for joint modeling. It uses a unified absorbing diffusion process to handle both modalities, performing categorical prediction for sequences and continuous diffusion for structures. The model achieves competitive performance in tasks like co-generation and structure prediction, demonstrating the viability of combining categorical and continuous distributions in a unified architecture.
