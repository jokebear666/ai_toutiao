- **[arXiv251223] BeamformNet: Deep Learning-Based Beamforming Method for DoA Estimation via Implicit Spatial Signal Focusing and Noise Suppression**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [beamforming, spatial filter, deep learning, DoA estimation, neural networks, array signal processing]
  - **authors:** Xuyao Deng, Yong Dou, Kele Xu

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes BeamformNet, a deep learning framework that uses neural networks to approximate an optimal spatial filter for beamforming, enabling accurate direction-of-arrival estimation through implicit spatial signal focusing and noise suppression. Experimental results show that BeamformNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and better robustness, especially under demanding conditions like coherent sources and limited snapshots.

- **[arXiv251223] Mixed formulation and structure-preserving discretization of Cosserat rod dynamics in a port-Hamiltonian framework**
  - **tags:** [sys], [computational mechanics], [port-Hamiltonian framework, Cosserat rod, mixed formulation, finite element discretization, energy-momentum consistent integration, director formulation]
  - **authors:** Philipp L. Kinon, Simon R. Eugster, Peter Betsch

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes an energy-based modeling framework for spatial Cosserat rods using a mixed formulation and a port-Hamiltonian structure. It develops a structure-preserving finite element discretization leading to an energy-momentum consistent integration scheme. The framework is shown to be a new approach for energy-momentum consistent formulations in computational mechanics involving finite rotations.

  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [neural operator, adaptive numerical correction, exponential moving average, PDE residual, hybrid inference, error control, autoregressive framework]
  - **authors:** Rajyasri Roy, Dibyajyoti Nayak, Somdatta Goswami

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes ANCHOR, a hybrid framework that combines a pretrained neural operator with a classical numerical solver, using an adaptive, residual-based error estimator to monitor and correct errors during long-horizon PDE inference. This method stabilizes predictions and bounds error growth, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to standalone neural operators or expensive high-fidelity solvers.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces GLUE, a method that coordinates frozen, pre-trained generative models for engineering subsystems to produce feasible, diverse, and high-performing full-system designs. It proposes both data-driven and data-free training approaches, with the data-free method being particularly efficient, training a full generative model in about 10 minutes while requiring far fewer computational resources than data-driven methods. The work demonstrates a path to scaling generative design for complex engineering systems by integrating domain-specific submodels.
