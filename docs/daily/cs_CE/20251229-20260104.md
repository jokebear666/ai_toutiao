  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [quantum machine learning, batching, adjoint differentiation, performance benchmarking, time series forecasting]
  - **authors:** Jun-Hao Chen, Ming-Kai Hung, Yun-Cheng Tsai, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen
  - **institution:** National Taiwan Normal University, Wells Fargo Bank
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21820
  - **contributions:** 1. Introduced a unified Equal-Parameter-Count (EPC) benchmarking pipeline for quantum sequence models, enabling fair comparison of QLSTM and QFWP. 2. Provided a detailed system-oriented analysis of component-wise runtime scaling (forward/backward passes) with batch size under adjoint differentiation, revealing a bottleneck in backward pass scaling. 3. Identified a clear speed-accuracy Pareto frontier between the two models, with QFWP achieving higher accuracy and QLSTM achieving higher throughput.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper systematically compares two quantum sequence models, QLSTM and QFWP, for time series forecasting under an equal-parameter-count constraint. It analyzes their runtime performance across different batch sizes and finds that while forward passes scale well, backward passes scale modestly, limiting overall training speedup. The main conclusion is that QFWP offers better accuracy, QLSTM offers higher throughput, revealing a trade-off for practitioners.
