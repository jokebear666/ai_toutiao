  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces a topological feedback mechanism for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) by analyzing the divergence between a tour and the minimum spanning tree (MST). The core method is a canonical decomposition theorem that expresses the tour-MST length gap as edge-wise topological divergence gaps from the RTD-Lite barcode, which is then used to guide 2-opt and 3-opt heuristics. Experiments show that this topology-guided optimization improves performance and leads to faster convergence.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces a method for 3D mesh compression using a hierarchical implicit neural representation (INR) built upon a spherical parameterization of the mesh. The INR encodes a displacement vector field to reconstruct the original shape, first recovering coarse structure and then adding high-frequency details. The approach achieves a state-of-the-art trade-off between reconstruction quality and compressed representation size, enabling real-time decoding of meshes at arbitrary resolutions.

- **[arXiv251219] Do Multi-Agents Solve Better Than Single? Evaluating Agentic Frameworks for Diagram-Grounded Geometry Problem Solving and Reasoning**
  - **tags:** [ai], [multimodal reasoning], [multi-agent pipelines, single-agent pipelines, zero-shot evaluation, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), geometry problem solving]

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper systematically compares single-agent and multi-agent frameworks for solving diagram-based geometry problems using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in a zero-shot setting. It finds that multi-agent pipelines consistently improve performance for open-source models like Qwen-2.5-VL, while advanced closed-source models like Gemini-2.0-Flash generally perform better in single-agent mode, showing that agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.
