- **[arXiv251229] Graph Drawing Stress Model with Resistance Distances**
  - **tags:** [other], [graph drawing], [resistance distance, stress model, graph Laplacian, stochastic gradient descent, spectral embedding]
  - **authors:** Yosuke Onoue
  - **institution:** Nihon University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21901
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a new stress-based graph drawing paradigm using resistance distance instead of graph-theoretic shortest distance, which better captures global graph structure and admits an isometric embedding in Euclidean space. 2. Introduces Omega, a linear-time graph drawing algorithm that combines fast resistance distance embedding with random node-pair sampling for SGD, achieving more effective and robust optimization than pivot-based methods. 3. Establishes a practical and scalable connection between spectral graph theory and stress-based layouts, demonstrating improved neighborhood preservation and cluster faithfulness in visualizations.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper challenges the conventional use of shortest-path distances in stress-based graph drawing by proposing resistance distance as a superior alternative derived from the graph Laplacian. It introduces the Omega algorithm, which efficiently computes resistance distance embeddings and uses random sampling for SGD to produce more readable layouts with lower stress. The method effectively reveals global graph structures like clusters and maintains linear-time complexity for large networks.

  - **tags:** [other], [computational geometry], [art gallery problem, approximation algorithm, set cover, epsilon-net, deterministic algorithm]
  - **authors:** Khaled Elbassioni

  - **contributions:** 1. Provides a deterministic bicriteria approximation algorithm for the art gallery problem with holes, 2. Achieves a solution size of O(OPT * log(h+2) * log(OPT * log(h+2))) that sees (1-δ) of the polygon's area, 3.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents a deterministic algorithm for the art gallery problem in polygons with holes. The algorithm finds a set of guards whose size is within a polylogarithmic factor of the optimum, and these guards collectively see at least a (1-δ) fraction of the polygon's area. The running time is polynomial in the relevant input parameters.

- **[arXiv251230] Persistent Homology via Finite Topological Spaces**
  - **tags:** [other], [topological data analysis], [persistent homology, finite topological spaces, posets, crosscut complexes, stability]
  - **authors:** Selçuk Kayacan
  - **institution:** Bahçeşehir University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23348
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a functorial framework for persistent homology using filtrations of finite topological spaces and posets, bypassing the need for inclusion relations between simplicial complexes. 2. Demonstrates that standard simplifications at the poset level preserve persistent invariants. 3. Proves the stability of the resulting persistence diagrams under metric perturbations in a density-based instantiation.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes a new functorial framework for persistent homology that starts from a finite metric space and constructs a filtration of finite topological spaces, then functorially maps these to posets and simplicial complexes via crosscut constructions. This approach decouples the metric from the homological analysis and does not require inclusion maps between complexes. The authors show that poset-level simplifications preserve persistent invariants and prove the stability of the resulting persistence diagrams.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24061
  - **contributions:** 1. A novel SAT encoding for the 33-point Erdős–Szekeres problem using triple-orientation variables and a 4-set convexity criterion to exclude convex 7-gons. 2. The introduction of convex-layer anchoring constraints to reduce symmetry and enable systematic experimentation on anchored subfamilies. 3. The observation and analysis of pronounced runtime variability and heavy-tailed behavior in the SAT solving process, identifying a key challenge for computational effort.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper tackles the open Erdős–Szekeres problem of whether any set of 33 points contains a convex 7-gon (ES(7)=33). It proposes a SAT encoding based on geometric orientation variables and convexity constraints to search for counterexamples. The method yields UNSAT certificates for some subcases, but the computational effort is dominated by heavy-tailed runtime variability, motivating further encoding improvements.
