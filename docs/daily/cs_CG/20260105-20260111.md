- **[arXiv260105] An Output Sensitive Algorithm for Discrete Convex Hulls**
  - **tags:** [other], [computational geometry], [discrete convex hull, output-sensitive algorithm, integer lattice, convex body, diameter]
  - **authors:** Sariel Har-Peled
  - **institution:** Tel Aviv University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00392
  - **contributions:** 1. An output-sensitive algorithm for computing the discrete convex hull of a sufficiently round convex body in the plane, with a time complexity of O(|C⁰| log δ(C)), where |C⁰| is the number of output vertices and δ(C) is the diameter of C., 2. A demonstration that the algorithm's running time is bounded by O(δ(C)^\{2/3\} log δ(C)) using known combinatorial bounds on the number of vertices of a convex lattice polygon., 3. A solution to a problem raised by Pankaj Agarwal, providing an efficient method for generating a polygonal representation of a convex shape from its integer lattice points.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the problem of computing the discrete convex hull (the convex hull of integer lattice points inside a convex body) in the plane. It proposes an output-sensitive algorithm whose running time depends on the number of vertices in the output hull and the diameter of the input body. The main result is an algorithm with O(|C⁰| log δ(C)) time complexity, which translates to O(δ(C)^\{2/3\} log δ(C)) using known bounds, particularly applicable when the convex body is a disk.

- **[arXiv260105] On the Largest Convexity Number of Co-Finite Sets in the Plane**
  - **tags:** [other], [computational geometry], [convexity number, co-finite sets, point sets, covering problem, general position]
  - **authors:** Chaya Keller, Micha A. Perles
  - **institution:** Ariel University, Hebrew University of Jerusalem
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00414
  - **contributions:** 1. Established new lower and upper bounds for the largest convexity number f(n) of the complement of n points in the plane, specifically proving ⌊(n+5)/2⌋ ≤ f(n) ≤ (7n+44)/11 for n≥4. 2. Determined the exact convexity number for the case where the n points are in convex position, showing it is ⌊(n+5)/2⌋. 3. Solved a specific open problem posed by Lawrence and Morris regarding the convexity number of complements of finite point sets.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper studies the problem of covering the complement of a finite point set in the plane with the minimum number of convex sets, known as its convexity number. The authors prove new bounds for this number when the points are in general position and find its exact value when the points are in convex position. Their results resolve a problem from prior work in discrete and computational geometry.
