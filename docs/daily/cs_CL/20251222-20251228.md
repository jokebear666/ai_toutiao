The distilled model achieves an 8.1% absolute improvement over an unstructured baseline, primarily due to a reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that structured logical blueprints are beneficial for reliable SQL generation in small models.

It verifies unauthorized use by comparing token probabilities between a suspect model and a scoring model. The approach reliably detects watermarked data even when it constitutes a minuscule fraction of the training corpus, providing a scalable pre-release watermark for data owners.

- **[arXiv251222] When F1 Fails: Granularity-Aware Evaluation for Dialogue Topic Segmentation**
  - **tags:** [ai], [dialogue topic segmentation], [window-tolerant F1, boundary density, segment coherence, granularity-aware evaluation]
  - **authors:** Michael H. Coen
  - **institution:** Independent Researcher
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17083

It demonstrates through cross-dataset experiments that reported performance differences are often artifacts of annotation granularity mismatches, not model quality. The core conclusion is that topic segmentation should be viewed as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set.
