- **[arXiv251229] Query Carefully: Detecting the Unanswerables in Text-to-SQL Tasks**
  - **tags:** [db], [text-to-SQL], [unanswerable question detection, few-shot prompting, biomedical databases]
  - **authors:** Jasmin Saxer, Isabella Maria Aigner, Luise Linzmeier, Andreas Weiler, Kurt Stockinger
  - **institution:** Zurich University of Applied Sciences, University of Zurich
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21345
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposed Query Carefully, a pipeline integrating LLM-based SQL generation with explicit detection of unanswerable inputs. 2. Constructed OncoMX-NAQ, a benchmark dataset of 80 no-answer questions for biomedical text-to-SQL. 3. Demonstrated that balanced few-shot prompting with both answerable and unanswerable examples achieves high unanswerable-detection accuracy without degrading performance on answerable queries.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the risk of text-to-SQL systems generating executable but incorrect SQL for ambiguous or unanswerable queries, especially in biomedical contexts. The authors propose the Query Carefully pipeline, which uses an LLM with schema-aware prompts and few-shot examples to detect and abstain from unanswerable inputs. Their evaluation shows the method achieves high detection accuracy for structurally unanswerable queries, though challenges remain for semantic ambiguities like missing values.

- **[arXiv251229] Teaching People LLM's Errors and Getting it Right**
  - **tags:** [nlp], [human-ai interaction], [overreliance, failure patterns, mental models, user study, meta-labels]
  - **authors:** Nathan Stringham, Fateme Hashemi Chaleshtori, Xinyuan Yan, Zhichao Xu, Bei Wang, Ana Marasović
  - **institution:** University of Utah
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21422
  - **contributions:** 1. Empirically demonstrated that failure patterns for LLMs do exist by identifying sizable, error-prone meta-label groups in datasets, countering the hypothesis that their absence caused prior teaching failures. 2. Evaluated automated methods for discovering these failure patterns (prompting and embedding-based) and found mixed results, identifying a key bottleneck in the teaching pipeline. 3. Proposed and validated a new metric for teaching effectiveness—assessing a user's ability to anticipate LLM errors using taught patterns—which showed a positive effect, unlike traditional human-AI team accuracy.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates why prior attempts to teach users about LLM failure patterns to reduce overreliance have failed. It finds that failure patterns do exist, but automated methods to discover them are unreliable, and proposes a new user-centric evaluation metric that shows teaching can be effective. The conclusion is that teaching failure patterns is viable but requires better failure-discovery methods and appropriate metrics.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes SemDAC, a neural speech codec that uses semantic codebooks distilled from HuBERT as priors within an RVQ framework to separate phonetic from acoustic information. This method achieves better perceptual quality and lower word error rates for speech recognition at much lower bitrates compared to traditional neural codecs. The results show that semantic priors provide an effective inductive bias for efficient, recognition-friendly speech compression.

Conducts "Shortcut Experiments" to evaluate models under biased and out-of-distribution settings, demonstrating COCONUT exploits dataset artifacts rather than performing genuine reasoning. 3. Repositions COCONUT as a "pseudo-reasoning" mechanism that generates plausible traces to conceal shortcut dependence, challenging its claimed reasoning capabilities.

  - **contributions:** 1. Identifies and characterizes a new class of "secondary attention sinks" that arise in middle layers, have variable lifetimes, and draw moderate attention, differing from persistent primary sinks like BOS. 2. Shows that secondary sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules that map token representations to align with the primary sink's direction, with their L2-norm determining sink strength and lifetime. 3. Observes that in larger models, these sink patterns (sink levels) become more deterministic and frequent, with distinct levels identified in models like QwQ-32B and Qwen3-14B.

  - **authors:** Tsogt-Ochir Enkhbayar
  - **institution:** Mongol-AI (inferred from email domain)
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22293
  - **contributions:** 1. Empirically demonstrates that warning-framed training data fails to teach language models to avoid warned-against behaviors, showing generation rates similar to direct exposure. 2. Provides a mechanistic interpretation using sparse autoencoders, identifying a failure of feature orthogonalization where "describing" and "performing" an action activate overlapping latent features. 3. Identifies and names the "stealth slip" phenomenon, where conversational preambles can rotate activations into subspaces undetectable by linear probes, and shows that training-time feature ablation, not prompting, is required to address the issue.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates why language models trained on warning-framed examples (e.g., "DO NOT USE") still learn to generate the warned-against content. Through behavioral experiments and sparse autoencoder analysis, it finds that models learn statistical co-occurrences rather than pragmatic intent, due to overlapping latent features for description and action. The core conclusion is that current architectures prioritize pattern completion over understanding speaker intent, requiring training-time interventions like feature ablation for correction.

  - **authors:** Xuan Luo, Kailai Zhang, Xifeng Yan
  - **institution:** UC Santa Barbara
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22562
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes All-or-Here Attention (AHA), a novel attention mechanism that dynamically toggles between full and local sliding window attention using a binary router per head. 2. Demonstrates empirically that full attention is largely redundant, showing up to 93% of full attention operations can be replaced with local attention without performance loss. 3. Identifies a long-tail distribution in context dependency, revealing that the need for global context decays rapidly as the local window expands.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper addresses the computational inefficiency of full self-attention in LLMs by proposing All-or-Here Attention (AHA), which learns to dynamically switch between full and local sliding window attention for each token. The results show that most full attention operations are unnecessary, and efficient inference can be achieved with on-demand global context access.

Systematically characterizes a capability dichotomy where structured width pruning degrades parametric knowledge (e.g., MMLU) but significantly improves instruction-following (e.g., IFEval). 2. Discovers and quantifies a robust inverse correlation between factual knowledge and truthfulness, linking knowledge degradation under pruning to improved misconception discrimination. 3. Identifies the expansion ratio as a critical architectural parameter that selectively modulates cognitive capabilities, rather than just a compression metric, and quantifies its context-dependent efficiency trade-offs.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates structured width pruning of GLU-MLP layers in Llama-3.2 models using the Maximum Absolute Weight (MAW) criterion. It finds that pruning creates a dichotomy: while parametric knowledge degrades, instruction-following improves and multi-step reasoning remains robust, challenging the assumption of uniform degradation. The main conclusion is that width pruning acts as a selective filter, reducing knowledge but preserving or enhancing behavioral alignment, with identified trade-offs in efficiency.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper challenges the use of hint-verbalization metrics like Biasing Features for evaluating the faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought reasoning. It proposes that apparent unfaithfulness is often due to incompleteness from lossy compression and tight token limits, not a lack of alignment, and demonstrates this using new metrics and causal mediation analysis. The conclusion advocates for a broader interpretability toolkit beyond hint-based evaluations.

  - **contributions:** 1. Theoretically and empirically extends the neural scaling law to the "familial models" paradigm by introducing granularity (G) as a new fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and tokens (D). 2. Proposes a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to decouple architectural impact from computational scale, enabling high-fidelity parameterization of the unified scaling law L(N, D, G). 3. Quantifies that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent (γ≈0.041), validating the "train once, deploy many" paradigm without compromising compute-optimality.

Demonstrates that generation enhances understanding in large-scale VLM training only when operating at the semantic level (e.g., autoregressing high-level visual representations), not at the pixel level. 2. Shows that unified generation-understanding models exhibit superior data scaling trends and higher data utilization efficiency compared to understanding-only models. 3. Proposes that autoregression on input embeddings is an effective and modality-independent method for capturing visual details, enabling pixel-level generation from learned semantics.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23659
  - **contributions:** 1. Demonstrates that local, small-scale predictability measures (n-grams) are sufficient to explain probabilistic reduction in speech, challenging the necessity of large-context LLMs for this cognitive phenomenon. 2. Provides evidence that n-gram representations can serve as effective cognitive units of planning in language production. 3. Argues for the cognitive plausibility and computational efficiency of incremental, phrase-level planning over whole-utterance planning.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates how much context is needed to model the relationship between word predictability and articulatory reduction (probabilistic reduction). It finds that local n-gram probabilities are sufficient to explain this effect, suggesting that language production planning operates on a small, incremental scale rather than relying on large-context language models. The main conclusion is that "less is more"—small-scale predictability measures best explain the cognitive phenomenon of probabilistic reduction.

  - **contributions:** 1. Constructed a dataset of ~500 real ICML papers to empirically evaluate hidden prompt injection attacks in a realistic academic reviewing context. 2. Demonstrated that embedding semantically equivalent adversarial instructions in multiple languages (English, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic) can significantly alter LLM-generated review scores and decisions. 3. Revealed notable cross-lingual differences in attack effectiveness, with Arabic injections having minimal impact compared to others.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates the vulnerability of LLM-based academic peer review systems to hidden prompt injection attacks. By injecting adversarial instructions in four languages into a dataset of real papers and having an LLM review them, the authors found that such attacks can substantially change review outcomes for English, Japanese, and Chinese, but not Arabic. The results highlight a critical security risk and language-dependent susceptibility in automated reviewing pipelines.

  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces a novel dataset with fine-grained human feedback where annotators mark and explain "liked" and "disliked" spans in model responses. 2. Proposes a method to use this feedback to generate "feedback-driven improvement chains," where the base model incrementally rewrites disliked spans to create a sequence of improved responses. 3. Demonstrates that constructing preference pairs from adjacent steps in these chains for direct alignment outperforms standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites, leading to more efficient and effective preference tuning.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper compares how two transformer models detect bias in news text using SHAP-based explanations. It finds that while both models focus on similar evaluative language, a domain-adapted model integrates these signals more reliably, producing far fewer false positives than a standard bias detector. The study concludes that interpretability analysis is crucial for evaluating bias detection systems and that architectural choices critically impact their reliability for journalistic use.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24545
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposed Multi-Envelope Double Binary Factorization (MDBF), which replaces the single magnitude envelope in DBF with a rank-l envelope to enhance magnitude expressiveness while maintaining a shared binary sign carrier. 2. Introduced a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to effectively optimize the MDBF parameters. 3. Demonstrated that MDBF improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over prior binary formats on LLaMA and Qwen models at matched bit budgets while preserving the same efficient inference primitive.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper addresses the performance saturation of Double Binary Factorization (DBF) in extreme low-bit quantization of LLMs, where a single magnitude envelope limits expressiveness. It proposes Multi-Envelope DBF (MDBF), which uses multiple envelope components to allocate more expressivity to magnitudes while keeping binary sign matrices shared. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen families show MDBF outperforms previous binary formats in accuracy and perplexity at the same bit rate without changing the inference primitive.

  - **institution:** University of Amsterdam
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24939
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a critical framework for understanding "vibe coding" as "interface flattening," where distinct modalities converge into a conversational surface while the underlying translation chain thickens. 2. Conducts a materialist reconstruction of the vibe-coding stack, analyzing how remote compute, structured outputs, and protocols like MCP relocate control to model providers. 3. Demonstrates how LLM-mediated development redistributes symbolic power, obscures responsibility, and privatizes competencies, offering a critical lens on the political economy of AI-mediated interaction.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper analyzes the phenomenon of "vibe coding," where software is developed through natural language interaction with LLMs. It conceptualizes this as "interface flattening," arguing that while the user experience appears simplified, the underlying infrastructure and dependencies become more complex and concentrated. The main conclusion is that this apparent democratization of programming creates new dependencies, redistributes power to model providers, and privatizes competencies previously held by the programming community.

  - **contributions:** 1. Proposed a Quantum Inference Model (Q-VWSD) for unsupervised visual word sense disambiguation, using quantum superposition to encode multiple glosses and mitigate semantic biases. 2. Showed that Q-VWSD is a quantum generalization of classical probability-based methods and designed a heuristic version that runs efficiently on classical computers. 3. Demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art classical methods, especially by effectively leveraging non-specialized glosses from large language models.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the problem of semantic bias in visual word sense disambiguation by proposing a Quantum Inference Model (Q-VWSD) that uses quantum superposition to encode multiple glosses. The method is shown to be a quantum generalization of classical approaches, and a heuristic version is developed for efficient classical computation. Experiments show the method outperforms existing classical techniques, particularly when using glosses from large language models.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24969
  - **contributions:** 1. Demonstrates that the conditional entropy (code length) of English text continues to decrease with context length up to at least ~10^4 characters using LLMs, revealing long-range dependencies. 2. Shows empirically, independent of models, that small but significant correlations exist between characters at large separations. 3. Reveals that long-range structure in language is learned gradually during model training and that the distribution of code lengths shows emergent certainty for many characters at large context lengths.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper uses large language models (LLMs) to analyze the conditional entropy of English text over long contexts. The key finding is that entropy continues to decrease with context length up to at least 10^4 characters, indicating the presence of long-range dependencies and correlations in language. These results provide new constraints for building statistical physics models of language and LLMs.
