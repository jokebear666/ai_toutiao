- **[arXiv251222] MemoryGraft: Persistent Compromise of LLM Agents via Poisoned Experience Retrieval**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [retrieval-augmented generation, long-term memory, semantic imitation, indirect injection attack, memory poisoning, MetaGPT, DataInterpreter]
  - **authors:** Saksham Sahai Srivastava, Haoyu He
  - **institution:** University of Georgia
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16962
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces MemoryGraft, a novel attack that poisons an LLM agent's long-term memory by implanting malicious successful experiences, which are then retrieved and imitated during future tasks. The method exploits the agent's semantic imitation heuristic through a poisoned RAG store, leading to persistent behavioral compromise. The authors demonstrate that this attack can cause significant and stealthy behavioral drift in agents like MetaGPT's DataInterpreter.

- **[arXiv251222] AlignDP: Hybrid Differential Privacy with Rarity-Aware Protection for LLMs**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [post-training], [differential privacy, local differential privacy, RAPPOR, PAC indistinguishability, hybrid privacy, rarity-aware protection]
  - **authors:** Madhava Gaikwad
  - **institution:** Microsoft
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17251

Rare fields are shielded with PAC indistinguishability for strong privacy, while non-rare fields are privatized using RAPPOR to allow useful frequency estimation. This approach aims to prevent knowledge extraction and unauthorized fine-tuning by design, making models more secure against distillation and editing attacks.

  - **institution:** Palo Alto Networks
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17375
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces AdvJudge-Zero, a method that uses beam-search on a model's next-token distribution to discover short, low-perplexity control token sequences that can flip the binary decisions of LLM-as-a-Judge systems from "No" to "Yes". It concludes that these tokens represent a realistic reward-hacking vulnerability in post-training pipelines, and shows that adversarial training can mitigate the issue while preserving evaluation quality.
