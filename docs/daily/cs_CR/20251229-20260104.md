Demonstrates that short-duration LiDAR-induced object hallucinations can trigger unsafe braking, delayed hazard responses, and unstable control., 3. Shows that controller failures are more influenced by the temporal consistency of spoofed objects than by spatial inaccuracies alone.

  - **contributions:** 1. Empirically demonstrates that warning-framed training data fails to teach language models to avoid warned-against behaviors, showing generation rates similar to direct exposure. 2. Provides a mechanistic interpretation using sparse autoencoders, identifying a failure of feature orthogonalization where "describing" and "performing" an action activate overlapping latent features. 3. Identifies and names the "stealth slip" phenomenon, where conversational preambles can rotate activations into subspaces undetectable by linear probes, and shows that training-time feature ablation, not prompting, is required to address the issue.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates why language models trained on warning-framed examples (e.g., "DO NOT USE") still learn to generate the warned-against content. Through behavioral experiments and sparse autoencoder analysis, it finds that models learn statistical co-occurrences rather than pragmatic intent, due to overlapping latent features for description and action. The core conclusion is that current architectures prioritize pattern completion over understanding speaker intent, requiring training-time interventions like feature ablation for correction.

  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a scenario-based statistical risk model for timing leakage in lattice-based PQC, framing it as a problem of distributional distinguishability under controlled execution conditions (idle, jitter, loaded). 2. Synthesizes traces for multiple leakage models and quantifies leakage using a combination of statistical tests (Welch's t-test, KS distance, Cliff's delta, mutual information, distribution overlap) combined in a TLRI-like manner to produce a consistent risk score. 3. Empirically analyzes and compares the timing side-channel risk across representative lattice-based KEM families (Kyber, Saber, Frodo), identifying that idle conditions yield the highest distinguishability and that cache-index/branch-style leaks pose the highest risk.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a statistical risk model to assess timing side-channel vulnerabilities in lattice-based post-quantum cryptographic implementations under different environmental noise scenarios. The method synthesizes execution traces and quantifies leakage using multiple statistical metrics combined into a single risk score for scenario ranking. The analysis shows that idle execution conditions are most vulnerable, and faster schemes like Kyber can exhibit higher peak risk, enabling early-stage, reproducible comparisons before hardware-specific testing.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22526
  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces the concept of "Verifiable Dropout," a novel mechanism that treats stochasticity in training as a verifiable claim rather than a source of ambiguity. 2. Proposes a privacy-preserving method using zero-knowledge proofs to bind dropout masks to a deterministic, cryptographically verifiable seed, enabling post-hoc integrity audits. 3. Addresses the "plausible deniability" gap in cloud-based AI training by allowing verification that stochastic operations were executed honestly without exposing sensitive model or data information.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper identifies a security gap in cloud-based AI training where stochastic operations like dropout allow attackers to mask manipulations as random variance. To solve this, it proposes Verifiable Dropout, a method using zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically verify the correct execution of dropout, ensuring integrity while preserving privacy. This enables post-hoc audits to confirm randomness was not biased, closing the accountability loophole in stochastic training.

  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes SemCovert, a deep semantic-level hiding framework for secure and covert video transmission, integrating co-designed hiding and extraction models into the semantic communication pipeline. 2. Introduces a randomized semantic hiding strategy to break embedding determinism and introduce unpredictable distribution patterns, improving resistance to analysis. 3. Demonstrates through experiments that the framework effectively mitigates eavesdropping/detection risks, reliably conceals secret videos with minor video quality degradation, preserving transmission fidelity.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses privacy leakage in video semantic communication by proposing SemCovert, a framework that hides secret information at the semantic level using co-designed models and a randomized hiding strategy. The method enables authorized recovery while remaining imperceptible to regular users and resistant to statistical analysis. Experimental results confirm its effectiveness for secure and covert transmission without significantly compromising video quality.
