  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes Spatia, a video generation framework that uses an updatable 3D scene point cloud as persistent spatial memory to enhance long-term spatial consistency. It iteratively generates video clips conditioned on this memory and updates it via visual SLAM, enabling applications like explicit camera control and 3D-aware interactive editing.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces PyFi, a framework that uses a multi-agent adversarial mechanism under Monte Carlo Tree Search to synthesize a large-scale, pyramid-structured financial image QA dataset without human annotation. Fine-tuning VLMs on this dataset enables them to decompose complex financial questions into simpler sub-questions, leading to significant accuracy improvements on the benchmark.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14796
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD), a self-supervised framework that learns unified image representations by linking low-magnification context with spatially aligned high-magnification detail in whole-slide images. The resulting foundation model, MAD-NP, demonstrates strong resolution-invariant learning, as shown by a classifier trained on 10x embeddings maintaining 96.7% performance on unseen 40x tiles. The work concludes that this approach enables scalable, magnification-robust analysis using a unified embedding space.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper develops a deep learning system to analyze diagnostic laparoscopy videos for advanced ovarian cancer, automating the assessment of peritoneal carcinosis and predicting the Fagotti score to guide surgical decisions. The AI model segments anatomical structures and tumor lesions, then classifies video-level features to estimate surgical feasibility. The results demonstrate reproducible performance, suggesting AI can standardize intraoperative tumor burden assessment and support clinical decision-making.

  - **institution:** University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15034
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a new method for atomic electron tomography that directly solves for atomic positions and properties by parameterizing the structure as a collection of learnable Gaussians, rather than first reconstructing a volumetric image. This approach incorporates a strong physical prior, which improves robustness to imaging artifacts like those from limited tilt angles. Simulated and experimental results demonstrate its potential for practical materials characterization.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15061
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes improved meta-learners for few-shot, weakly-supervised segmentation of the optic disc and cup in fundus images. The core method introduces Omni meta-training for balanced data usage and efficient versions to reduce computational costs, along with sparsification techniques for generating scribbles. The best model, EO-ProtoSeg, achieves high segmentation accuracy using only one sparsely labeled image, outperforming methods that require more labels and being comparable to heavier unsupervised domain adaptation approaches.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a two-stage generative preprocessing method for image compression using a pre-trained diffusion model. It first distills Stable Diffusion 2.1 into a one-step model and then fine-tunes it with a Rate-Perception loss. The method achieves significant perceptual quality improvements and integrates seamlessly with standard codecs.
