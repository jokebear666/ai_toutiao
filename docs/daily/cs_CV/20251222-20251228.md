  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16954
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a multi-stage pipeline for generating long, character-consistent video stories. It uses an LLM to create a script, a text-to-image model to design consistent character visuals as anchors, and a video generation model to synthesize scenes individually, with a temporal bridge linking them. The method's necessity is validated by showing that removing visual anchoring causes a catastrophic drop in character consistency, and cultural biases in current models are also analyzed.
