  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16954
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a multi-stage pipeline for generating long, character-consistent video stories. It uses an LLM to create a script, a text-to-image model to design consistent character visuals as anchors, and a video generation model to synthesize scenes individually, with a temporal bridge linking them. The method's necessity is validated by showing that removing visual anchoring causes a catastrophic drop in character consistency, and cultural biases in current models are also analyzed.

To study this, the authors introduce YearGuessr, a large multi-modal benchmark dataset for building age prediction framed as ordinal regression, and propose metrics to measure bias. Their evaluation confirms VLMs excel on popular items but struggle with unrecognized subjects, revealing a critical flaw in reasoning.

  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces a three-axis redundancy elimination framework (spatial, temporal, timestep) for efficient high-resolution video generation. 2. Proposes a dual-resolution caching mechanism for spatial compression and a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache for temporal compression. 3. Demonstrates state-of-the-art visual quality with up to 107.5x faster denoising compared to baselines, making 1080p video generation practical.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper addresses the computational bottleneck of high-resolution video generation by proposing HiStream, an autoregressive framework that eliminates redundancy across spatial, temporal, and timestep dimensions. The method achieves significant speedups (up to 107.5x) with negligible quality loss, making high-fidelity 1080p video generation scalable and practical.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the challenge of low image quality in Cone Beam CT (CBCT) by proposing LIRE++, a deep learning-based reconstruction method. LIRE++ incorporates rotational equivariance and multiscale processing for efficiency and was trained using a custom fast simulator. It shows improved reconstruction quality over existing methods on both simulated and real clinical data.
