- **[arXiv251222] The Role of Islamic Ethics in Preventing the Abuse of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Based Deepfakes**
  - **tags:** [ai], [ethics and society], [Systematic Literature Review (SLR), PRISMA, Maqasid al-Shariah, hifz al-ird, hifz al-nafs, adl, tabayyun]
  - **authors:** Wisnu Uriawan, Imany Fauzy Rahman, Muhamad Zidan, Irma Rohmatillah, Muhammad Arkan Raihan, Irma Dwiyanti
  - **institution:** UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17218
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This study employs a Systematic Literature Review (SLISMA) to formulate an Islamic ethical framework for preventing deepfake abuse. It concludes that principles from Maqasid al-Shariah, such as protecting honor and self, provide a normative basis for shifting from punitive to preventative approaches, focusing on human dignity and the common good in the digital age.

- **[arXiv251222] Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Dataset of Individual Daily Trajectories for City-Scale Mobility Analytics**
  - **tags:** [ai], [privacy-preserving data synthesis], [multi-objective optimization, origin-destination matrices, dwell-travel time quantiles, universal law of daily visited locations, synthetic trajectory generation]
  - **authors:** Jun'ichi Ozaki, Ryosuke Susuta, Takuhiro Moriyama, Yohei Shida
  - **institution:** Not explicitly provided; cannot infer from given information.
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17239
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a method to generate a privacy-preserving synthetic dataset of individual daily trajectories by integrating aggregated origin-destination flows with behavioral constraints in a multi-objective optimization framework. The method successfully reproduces realistic human mobility patterns in two Japanese regions, providing a practical pathway for high-resolution mobility analytics without using sensitive personal data.

- **[arXiv251222] Are Vision Language Models Cross-Cultural Theory of Mind Reasoners?**
  - **tags:** [ai], [vision-language models], [CulturalToM-VQA, visual question answering, chain-of-thought prompting, compositional chain-of-thought prompting, false belief reasoning, social desirability bias]
  - **authors:** Zabir Al Nazi, G M Shahariar, Abrar Hossain, Wei Peng
  - **institution:** University of California, Riverside, University of Dhaka, Stanford University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17394
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces CulturalToM-VQA, a benchmark dataset built via a VLM-assisted human-in-the-loop pipeline to evaluate cross-cultural Theory of Mind reasoning in Vision-Language Models. It finds that while newer VLMs show strong performance on explicit tasks, they systematically struggle with false belief reasoning, and their results may be inflated by social desirability bias rather than genuine visual understanding.

- **[arXiv251222] Fair Voting Methods as a Catalyst for Democratic Resilience: A Trilogy on Legitimacy, Impact and AI Safeguarding**
  - **tags:** [ai], [democratic systems], [fair voting methods, cumulative voting, equal shares, proportional representation, participatory budgeting, AI voting assistance]
  - **authors:** Evangelos Pournaras
  - **institution:** University of Leeds
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17461
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes that combining expressive ballot formats like cumulative voting with proportional aggregation methods like equal shares constitutes a "fair voting method." It concludes that such methods enhance democratic legitimacy, accelerate impactful outcomes in areas like welfare and education, and serve as a safeguard against biases in emerging AI-assisted voting scenarios.

- **[arXiv251222] Integrating Computational Methods and AI into Qualitative Studies of Aging and Later Life**
  - **tags:** [ai], [computational social science], [computational text analysis, machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), ethnography, in-depth interviews, mixed-methods]
  - **authors:** Corey M. Abramson
  - **institution:** Rice University, UC San Francisco
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17850
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper demonstrates how computational social science tools like machine learning and natural language processing can be integrated with traditional qualitative methods (e.g., ethnography, interviews) to study aging. It concludes that these computational methods can broaden qualitative research by streamlining workflows, scaling up projects, and enabling new multi-method insights, rather than replacing its foundational approaches.

- **[arXiv251222] Penalized Fair Regression for Multiple Groups in Chronic Kidney Disease**
  - **tags:** [ai], [fair machine learning], [penalized regression, cost-sensitive classification, true positive rate disparity penalties]
  - **authors:** Carter H. Nakamoto, Lucia Lushi Chen, Agata Foryciarz, Sherri Rose
  - **institution:** Stanford University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17340
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes a penalized fair regression framework using unfairness penalties for multiple groups, implemented via reduction to cost-sensitive classification. The method is applied to predict end-stage renal disease in a chronic kidney disease study, showing substantial fairness improvements for multiple race and ethnicity groups without appreciable loss in overall model fit.
