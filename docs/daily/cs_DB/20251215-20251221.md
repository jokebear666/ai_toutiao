  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces Graph Pattern-based Association Rules (GPARs) for analyzing directed labeled multigraphs like RDF graphs. It evaluates these rules under a "no-repeated-anything" semantics to better account for graph topology and defines probabilistic metrics like confidence and lift. The framework is shown to extend beyond existing formalisms for graph data.
