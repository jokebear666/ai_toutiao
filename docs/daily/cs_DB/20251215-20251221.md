  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces Graph Pattern-based Association Rules (GPARs) for analyzing directed labeled multigraphs like RDF graphs. It evaluates these rules under a "no-repeated-anything" semantics to better account for graph topology and defines probabilistic metrics like confidence and lift. The framework is shown to extend beyond existing formalisms for graph data.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces GRAST-SQL, a framework for scaling Text2SQL systems by efficiently filtering and compacting database schemas before prompting an LLM. It uses a query-aware LLM encoder, a graph transformer over functional dependencies, and a Steiner-tree heuristic to select a relevant, connectivity-preserving sub-schema. The method achieves high recall and precision while maintaining low latency and scaling to schemas with over 23,000 columns.

- **[arXiv251219] ModelTables: A Corpus of Tables about Models**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [table retrieval, model lakes, data lakes, unionable tables, joinable tables, dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, hybrid retrieval, benchmark construction]
  - **authors:** Zhengyuan Dong, Victor Zhong, Renée J. Miller
  - **institution:** University of Waterloo
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16106
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces ModelTables, a benchmark corpus of structured tables describing AI models, built from sources like Hugging Face model cards and GitHub READMEs. It evaluates table search methods, finding that table-based dense retrieval performs best but leaves significant room for improvement. The work provides a foundation for better semantic retrieval and organization of structured model knowledge.
