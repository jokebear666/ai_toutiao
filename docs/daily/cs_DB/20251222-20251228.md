  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes Struct-SQL, a knowledge distillation framework that trains a small language model using a structured chain-of-thought derived from query execution plans, rather than unstructured reasoning traces. The distilled model achieves an 8.1% absolute improvement over an unstructured baseline, primarily due to a reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that structured logical blueprints are beneficial for reliable SQL generation in small models.
