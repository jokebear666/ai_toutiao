  - **contributions:** 1. Proposed Query Carefully, a pipeline integrating LLM-based SQL generation with explicit detection of unanswerable inputs. 2. Constructed OncoMX-NAQ, a benchmark dataset of 80 no-answer questions for biomedical text-to-SQL. 3.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the risk of text-to-SQL systems generating executable but incorrect SQL for ambiguous or unanswerable queries, especially in biomedical contexts. The authors propose the Query Carefully pipeline, which uses an LLM with schema-aware prompts and few-shot examples to detect and abstain from unanswerable inputs. Their evaluation shows the method achieves high detection accuracy for structurally unanswerable queries, though challenges remain for semantic ambiguities like missing values.

  - **institution:** Inria, Université de Montpellier, INSERM, University of Toronto
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21499
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a simpler, polynomial-time algorithm for releasing weighted marginal queries under differential privacy using Fourier factorization, achieving exact optimality among factorization mechanisms. 2. Extends the algorithm to a more general class of product queries, maintaining exact optimality. 3. Shows the mechanism is almost optimal for extended marginal queries with threshold predicates, achieving optimal noise variance up to lower-order terms.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a new algorithm for releasing marginal and product queries under differential privacy by adding correlated Gaussian noise. The method works by releasing queries in the Fourier basis with independent, carefully calibrated noise and then reconstructing the answers, which is proven to be exactly optimal among factorization mechanisms and runs in polynomial time. It simplifies and improves upon prior work, extending optimality to more general query classes.

It proposes ESD, a mechanism that dispatches input samples to edge workers to minimize expected transmission cost, using a hybrid decision method called HybridDis. Experimental results show that ESD significantly reduces transmission cost and speeds up end-to-end training compared to state-of-the-art methods.
