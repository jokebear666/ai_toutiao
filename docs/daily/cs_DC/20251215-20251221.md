  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a privacy-preserving method for evaluating feature contributions in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) using Shapley-CMI and a Private Set Intersection (PSI) server to compute encrypted intersection sizes without sharing raw data. The system enables secure and fair data valuation before model training. Initial experiments confirm the approach's correctness and privacy, demonstrating its viability for secure feature contribution estimation in VFL.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** LLMQ is an end-to-end CUDA/C++ framework that enables efficient 8-bit pretraining and fine-tuning of medium-sized language models on consumer GPUs by employing optimizations like activation checkpointing, offloading, and copy-engine based collectives to overcome memory and communication bottlenecks. It demonstrates that models up to 32B parameters can be trained on affordable hardware like a 4xRTX 4090 workstation while maintaining high FLOP utilization, rivaling the efficiency of production systems on more expensive cloud-grade GPUs.

- **[arXiv251218] Dynamic Rebatching for Efficient Early-Exit Inference with DREX**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [early-exit, dynamic rebatching, copy-free buffer, SLA-aware scheduler, KV cache, state-copying]

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15705
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes Dynamic Rebatching and the DREX system to efficiently batch requests in Early-Exit LLMs, where tokens can exit at different layers. DREX dynamically reorganizes batches at exit points using a copy-free buffer and a predictive scheduler, improving throughput by 2-12% while eliminating involuntary exits and preserving output quality.
