Identifies the root cause of inefficiency in MoE data shuffling as the misalignment between expert-major and device-major data layouts, requiring disaggregated transformation and communication. 2. Proposes FUSCO, a communication library that fuses data transformation and communication operations into a single, efficient pipeline to eliminate redundant data movement. 3. Introduces lightweight planning and load-balancing mechanisms to eliminate redundant communication and disperse traffic, further optimizing the shuffling process.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the performance bottleneck of distributed data shuffling in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model training and inference. It proposes FUSCO, a communication library that fuses data transformation and communication to align expert-major and device-major data layouts efficiently. Evaluations show FUSCO achieves significant speedups over existing libraries like NCCL and DeepEP, reducing both training and inference latency.

  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes FedAuto, a novel Federated Fine-Tuning framework that mitigates the combined effects of unreliable connections and data heterogeneity via adaptive aggregation, requiring no prior knowledge of network conditions. 2. Establishes a rigorous, per-round convergence guarantee for FedAuto that holds for each individual realization, removing common assumptions on failure probabilities or client selection. 3. Demonstrates through extensive experiments that FedAuto outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under diverse failure scenarios for both full and partial-parameter fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA).

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper addresses the performance degradation of Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT) in real-world networks with unreliable connections and heterogeneous data. It proposes FedAuto, a framework that uses adaptive aggregation to handle these issues without prior network knowledge or infrastructure changes. Experiments show FedAuto consistently outperforms existing methods and provides stronger theoretical convergence guarantees.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces PRAXIS, an orchestrator that uses an LLM-driven agent to traverse service dependency graphs and program dependence graphs to diagnose the root cause of code- and configuration-related cloud incidents. Compared to ReAct baselines, PRAXIS improves RCA accuracy by up to 3.1x while reducing token consumption by 3.8x, as demonstrated on a benchmark of 30 real-world incidents.
