Introduces LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces that separate policy and mechanism, making the synthesis tractable and enabling even small LLMs to generate correct code. 3. Demonstrates the framework's effectiveness by synthesizing heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering that outperform state-of-the-art human-designed algorithms.

  - **contributions:** 1. Proposed the Modular Entanglement Hub (ModEn-Hub) architecture, a hub-and-spoke photonic interconnect with a central orchestrator for managing entanglement resources. 2. Introduced an adaptive orchestration policy featuring logarithmically scaled parallelism and opportunistic caching of entanglement bits (ebits). 3. Demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulation that the orchestrated system sustains high teleportation success rates (~90%) across many QPUs, significantly outperforming a naive sequential baseline.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** To scale quantum computing, the paper proposes the Modular Entanglement Hub (ModEn-Hub) architecture, which centralizes entanglement generation and uses an adaptive orchestrator to manage resources. Simulation results show this approach maintains a high teleportation success rate of about 90% across 1-128 quantum processors, vastly outperforming a simple baseline, thus enabling scalable distributed quantum-HPC systems.
