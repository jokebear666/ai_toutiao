  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes the Intelligent Knowledge Mining Framework (IKMF), a conceptual dual-stream architecture that combines a horizontal AI-driven mining process with a parallel trustworthy archiving stream. It aims to bridge the gap between dynamic analysis and long-term preservation, transforming static data repositories into living, actionable knowledge ecosystems.
