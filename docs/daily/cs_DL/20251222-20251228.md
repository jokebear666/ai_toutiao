- **[arXiv251222] Intelligent Knowledge Mining Framework: Bridging AI Analysis and Trustworthy Preservation**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [Knowledge Mining, Digital Preservation, Semantic Web, Data Integration, Dual-Stream Architecture]
  - **authors:** Binh Vu
  - **institution:** FernUniversität in Hagen
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17795
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes the Intelligent Knowledge Mining Framework (IKMF), a conceptual dual-stream architecture that combines a horizontal AI-driven mining process with a parallel trustworthy archiving stream. It aims to bridge the gap between dynamic analysis and long-term preservation, transforming static data repositories into living, actionable knowledge ecosystems.

- **[arXiv251223] Layout-Aware Text Editing for Efficient Transformation of Academic PDFs to Markdown**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [Document Layout Analysis, Text-Editing Model, Fill in the Middle, hybrid editing-generation]
  - **authors:** Changxu Duan
  - **institution:** Technische Universität Darmstadt
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18115
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces EditTrans, a hybrid editing-generation model that first identifies text requiring editing from a PDF using a Document Layout Analysis classifier before generating markup language. This approach reduces the need to regenerate dense text from scratch, significantly improving efficiency. Evaluations show EditTrans reduces transformation latency by up to 44.5% compared to end-to-end decoder transformer models while maintaining quality.

- **[arXiv251223] Accelerating End-to-End PDF to Markdown Conversion Through Assisted Generation**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [multi-modal inference], [Copy Lookup Decoding, Prompt Lookup Decoding, PDF-to-Markdown conversion, assisted generation, n-gram overlap]
  - **authors:** Changxu Duan
  - **institution:** Technische Universität Darmstadt

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces Copy Lookup Decoding (CLD), a method that accelerates end-to-end PDF-to-Markdown conversion by modifying Prompt Lookup Decoding to directly extract candidate text sequences from the source PDF, leveraging high n-gram overlap. Experiments show that CLD can speed up the conversion process by up to 1.70x while maintaining output quality. The associated code is open-sourced.
