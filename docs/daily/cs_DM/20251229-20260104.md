  - **institution:** Institute for Basic Science (IBS), KAIST, Utrecht University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21896
  - **contributions:** 1. Proved that delineation (the equivalence between tractable FO model checking and bounded twin-width) holds for intersection graphs of non-degenerate axis-parallel unit segments. 2.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates the relationship between tractable first-order (FO) logic model checking and the graph parameter twin-width for specific geometric graph classes. It answers open questions by proving this equivalence (delineation) holds for intersection graphs of axis-parallel unit segments and circular arcs, but fails for visibility graphs of 1.5D terrains. The work leverages the theory of twin-width for ordered graphs, exploiting natural vertex orderings in geometric representations.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates the computational complexity of the Minimum Secure Domination problem on various graph classes. By analyzing structural restrictions like chordality on bisplit graphs, it establishes a P vs. NP-Complete dichotomy and proves polynomial-time solvability for chain graphs. The main conclusion is that the problem is NP-complete on general bisplit graphs and hard to approximate, but becomes tractable under specific structural constraints.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24850
  - **contributions:** 1. Resolved the Erdős–Lovász problem under the transversal interpretation by proving a 3-uniform hypergraph with τ(H)=3 and τ(H-e)=2 for every edge e has at most 10 edges, implying δ(H)≤6. 2. Showed the bound δ(H)≤6 is sharp by identifying the complete 3-graph K_5^(3) as an example. 3. Resolved the problem under the chromatic interpretation by constructing an explicit 3-uniform hypergraph on 9 vertices with χ(H)=3 and δ(H)=7 that is critical (edge and vertex deletion makes it 2-colourable).

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper resolves an open problem by Erdős and Lovász concerning the existence of a 3-critical 3-uniform hypergraph with minimum degree at least 7. It addresses two interpretations of "critical": for the transversal number, it proves such a hypergraph cannot have minimum degree 7 (the maximum is 6), and for weak vertex-colouring, it explicitly constructs a hypergraph with 9 vertices and minimum degree 7 that is 3-critical. The results are certified by theoretical proofs and computational verification.

  - **contributions:** 1. Constructed a four-dimensional lattice-gas model with finite-range interactions that exhibits non-periodic, quasicrystalline Gibbs states at low temperatures. 2. Established a connection between the model's Gibbs states and the space-time trajectories of a probabilistic cellular automaton built upon Ammann's aperiodic tiles. 3. Demonstrated stability of the non-periodic trajectories against noise through an error-correction mechanism and repetition along extra dimensions.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper addresses the stability of quasicrystals at positive temperatures by constructing a 4D lattice-gas model with finite-range interactions. The method leverages a correspondence between probabilistic cellular automata and Gibbs measures, using Ammann's aperiodic tiles to generate non-periodic ground states. The main conclusion is the successful construction of a model where low-temperature Gibbs states are small perturbations of these aperiodic tilings, stabilized by an error-correction mechanism.
