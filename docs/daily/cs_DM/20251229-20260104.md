  - **tags:** [other], [parameterized complexity], [twin-width, first-order logic, model checking, geometric graphs, FPT]
  - **authors:** Colin Geniet, Gunwoo Kim, Lucas Meijer
  - **institution:** Institute for Basic Science (IBS), KAIST, Utrecht University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21896
  - **contributions:** 1. Proved that delineation (the equivalence between tractable FO model checking and bounded twin-width) holds for intersection graphs of non-degenerate axis-parallel unit segments. 2. Showed that delineation fails for visibility graphs of 1.5D terrains. 3. Proved delineation for intersection graphs of circular arcs.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates the relationship between tractable first-order (FO) logic model checking and the graph parameter twin-width for specific geometric graph classes. It answers open questions by proving this equivalence (delineation) holds for intersection graphs of axis-parallel unit segments and circular arcs, but fails for visibility graphs of 1.5D terrains. The work leverages the theory of twin-width for ordered graphs, exploiting natural vertex orderings in geometric representations.
