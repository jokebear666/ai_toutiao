- **[arXiv260105] Symmetric Submodular Functions, Uncrossable Functions, and Structural Submodularity**
  - **tags:** [other], [combinatorial optimization], [structural submodularity, pliable family, uncrossable family, symmetric submodular function]
  - **authors:** Miles Simmons, Ishan Bansal, Joe Cheriyan
  - **institution:** University of Waterloo, Cornell University, Amazon
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00140
  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces and formalizes the concept of a pliable family of sets satisfying structural submodularity, connecting it to prior work on abstract separation systems and uncrossable families. 2. Constructs, for any integer d≥2, a specific pliable family that satisfies structural submodularity. 3. Proves that this constructed family is not representable as the sublevel set of any symmetric submodular function and cannot be partitioned into d or fewer uncrossable families.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper studies combinatorial properties of set families, specifically pliable families that satisfy structural submodularity. It constructs a counterexample family to show that not every such family can be represented by a symmetric submodular function. Furthermore, it proves this family is complex in that it cannot be decomposed into a small number of simpler uncrossable families.

- **[arXiv260105] Solution to a problem on isolation of cliques in uniform hypergraphs**
  - **tags:** [other], [extremal combinatorics], [hypergraph isolation, clique isolation number, extremal structures, closed neighbourhood]
  - **authors:** Peter Borg
  - **institution:** University of Malta
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00104
  - **contributions:** 1. Proves an upper bound for the $K_k^r$-isolation number in connected $r$-uniform hypergraphs, showing it is at most $n/(k+1)$ except for specific extremal cases. 2. Solves a recent open problem posed by Li, Zhang and Ye regarding clique isolation in hypergraphs. 3. Determines the extremal structures for the isolation problem for all $r \ge 2$ by leveraging known results for the graph case ($r=2$).

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the problem of finding the smallest set of vertices whose closed neighborhood intersects all copies of a complete $r$-uniform hypergraph $K_k^r$ within a connected host hypergraph. The main result proves that this isolation number is at most $n/(k+1)$, with precisely characterized exceptions, thereby solving a recent conjecture. The proof builds upon the known graph case result to establish the general hypergraph bound and its extremal structures.

  - **contributions:** 1. Improved the lower bound on the length of an induced rainbow path in a properly colored triangle-free graph from (log log log k)^(1/3 - o(1)) to (log k)^(1/2 - o(1)) vertices. 2. Proved the existence of an induced path that contains at least k/2 distinct colors in such a graph. 3. Advanced progress towards a conjecture about the existence of an induced rainbow path of length equal to the chromatic number k.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper studies a conjecture about the existence of long induced rainbow paths in properly colored triangle-free graphs. The authors improve the known lower bound on the length of such a path from a triple-logarithmic function to a square-root-logarithmic function of the chromatic number. They also prove the existence of an induced path that contains at least half of the total colors.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00720
  - **contributions:** 1. A comparative benchmark of three distinct quantum computing paradigms (quantum annealing, gate-based QAOA, and photonic variational circuits) applied to the NP-hard Minimum Edge Multiway Cut problem. 2. An empirical assessment of the trade-offs in circuit constraints, encoding overhead, and scalability for early-stage quantum optimization on this problem class. 3. Actionable insights indicating that quantum annealing currently offers the most scalable performance for this problem, while photonic and gate-based approaches are limited by current hardware and simulation depth.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper benchmarks the Minimum Edge Multiway Cut problem using three quantum computing approaches: D-Wave quantum annealing, IBM's gate-based QAOA, and photonic variational circuits on Quandela's Perceval. The study evaluates their feasibility for early-stage quantum optimization, finding that quantum annealing currently provides the best scalability, while the other two methods are constrained by hardware and simulation limitations.
