  - **institution:** CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Digital Futures
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15210
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes the label-consistent k-center problem, which aims to update an existing clustering solution with new data while limiting changes to a given budget. It introduces two constant-factor approximation algorithms for this problem. The experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

- **[arXiv251219] Provably Extracting the Features from a General Superposition**
  - **tags:** [ai], [feature learning], [superposition, query algorithm, Fourier space search, overcomplete regime]
  - **authors:** Allen Liu
  - **institution:** UC Berkeley
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15987
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents an efficient query algorithm that searches in Fourier space to recover hidden feature directions from a general superposition function. It successfully identifies all non-degenerate features and reconstructs the function, working under more general conditions than prior methods.

- **[arXiv251219] Learning Confidence Ellipsoids and Applications to Robust Subspace Recovery**
  - **tags:** [ai], [robust statistics], [confidence ellipsoids, minimum volume estimator, primal-dual structure, geometric Brascamp-Lieb inequality, robust subspace recovery]
  - **authors:** Chao Gao, Liren Shan, Vaidehi Srinivas, Aravindan Vijayaraghavan
  - **institution:** University of Chicago, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, Northwestern University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16875
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm for finding confidence ellipsoids with bounded condition number, achieving a volume approximation factor of O(β^(γd)) while covering at least 1-O(α/γ) probability mass. The method leverages the primal-dual structure of minimum volume enclosing ellipsoids and the geometric Brascamp-Lieb inequality. As a key application, this yields the first polynomial-time algorithm with approximation guarantees for worst-case instances of the robust subspace recovery problem.
