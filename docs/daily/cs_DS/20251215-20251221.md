  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes the label-consistent k-center problem, which aims to update an existing clustering solution with new data while limiting changes to a given budget. It introduces two constant-factor approximation algorithms for this problem. The experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
