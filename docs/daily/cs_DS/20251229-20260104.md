- **[arXiv251229] Weighted Fourier Factorizations: Optimal Gaussian Noise for Differentially Private Marginal and Product Queries**
  - **tags:** [sec], [differential privacy], [factorization mechanism, Fourier basis, marginal queries, product queries, Gaussian noise]
  - **authors:** Christian Janos Lebeda, Aleksandar Nikolov, Haohua Tang
  - **institution:** Inria, Université de Montpellier, INSERM, University of Toronto
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21499
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a simpler, polynomial-time algorithm for releasing weighted marginal queries under differential privacy using Fourier factorization, achieving exact optimality among factorization mechanisms. 2. Extends the algorithm to a more general class of product queries, maintaining exact optimality. 3. Shows the mechanism is almost optimal for extended marginal queries with threshold predicates, achieving optimal noise variance up to lower-order terms.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a new algorithm for releasing marginal and product queries under differential privacy by adding correlated Gaussian noise. The method works by releasing queries in the Fourier basis with independent, carefully calibrated noise and then reconstructing the answers, which is proven to be exactly optimal among factorization mechanisms and runs in polynomial time. It simplifies and improves upon prior work, extending optimality to more general query classes.

  - **contributions:** 1. Presents the first fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining spectral sparsifiers of directed hypergraphs with near-optimal size and efficient update time. 2. Achieves an amortized update time of O(r^2 log^3 m) and a sparsifier size of O(n^2 / ε^2 log^7 m). 3. Extends the algorithm to the parallel batch-dynamic setting, enabling efficient batch processing of hyperedge updates with low depth.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces a new algorithm for dynamically maintaining spectral sparsifiers for directed hypergraphs. The method supports efficient updates (insertions/deletions of hyperedges) and can also process batches of updates in parallel. The main conclusion is that it provides the first spectral-based sparsification algorithm for this dynamic and parallel setting with near-optimal theoretical guarantees.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents BLEST, a framework that accelerates Breadth-First Search (BFS) on GPUs by efficiently mapping the irregular computation onto dense-math Tensor Cores. The method reformulates the BFS pipeline using a bitmap-oriented structure, specialized load balancing, graph reordering, and kernel fusion. Experiments show that BLEST achieves significant speedups (3.58x to 4.9x) over state-of-the-art GPU-based BFS implementations.
