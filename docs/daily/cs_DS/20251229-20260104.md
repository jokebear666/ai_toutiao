- **[arXiv251229] Weighted Fourier Factorizations: Optimal Gaussian Noise for Differentially Private Marginal and Product Queries**
  - **tags:** [sec], [differential privacy], [factorization mechanism, Fourier basis, marginal queries, product queries, Gaussian noise]
  - **authors:** Christian Janos Lebeda, Aleksandar Nikolov, Haohua Tang
  - **institution:** Inria, Université de Montpellier, INSERM, University of Toronto
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21499
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a simpler, polynomial-time algorithm for releasing weighted marginal queries under differential privacy using Fourier factorization, achieving exact optimality among factorization mechanisms. 2. Extends the algorithm to a more general class of product queries, maintaining exact optimality. 3. Shows the mechanism is almost optimal for extended marginal queries with threshold predicates, achieving optimal noise variance up to lower-order terms.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a new algorithm for releasing marginal and product queries under differential privacy by adding correlated Gaussian noise. The method works by releasing queries in the Fourier basis with independent, carefully calibrated noise and then reconstructing the answers, which is proven to be exactly optimal among factorization mechanisms and runs in polynomial time. It simplifies and improves upon prior work, extending optimality to more general query classes.

Proves unconditional lower bounds on the size of tropical circuits (modeling pure dynamic programming) for solving connectivity problems like TSP on graphs of bounded pathwidth. 2. Establishes a connection between tropical circuit complexity and the nondeterministic communication complexity of compatibility matrices. 3.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24522
  - **contributions:** 1. A new algorithm for exact sampling from the set of proper colorings of a graph., 2. The algorithm achieves an expected running time linear in the graph size for graphs with maximum degree Δ., 3. It is the first algorithm with this guarantee when the number of colors exceeds 3.637Δ + 1.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents a new algorithm for exactly sampling proper colorings of a graph. It is the first algorithm whose expected running time is guaranteed to be linear in the graph size when the number of colors is greater than 3.637 times the graph's maximum degree plus one.

  - **authors:** Igor N. Tunev
  - **institution:** Ural Federal University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24581
  - **contributions:** 1. A new method for proving specific cases of Dejean's conjecture for odd n≥5 using polynomial-time computer verification, producing circular threshold words. 2. An improved proof method reducing verification conditions and extending the construction to even cases n≥6. 3. A method to construct stronger threshold words with exponents arbitrarily close to 1 using a threshold word tree with exponential growth.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents improved methods for constructing threshold words related to Dejean's conjecture. It introduces algorithms for generating circular threshold words for odd and even alphabet sizes and demonstrates the existence of threshold words where all long factors have exponents arbitrarily close to 1. The work is based on edited versions of the author's earlier student theses.
