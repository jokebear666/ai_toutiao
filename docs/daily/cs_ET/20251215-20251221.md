  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces IPNet, a neuromorphic architecture that uses Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) neurons with intrinsic plasticity to physically emulate human-like working memory. The hardware-software co-designed system achieves high accuracy on dynamic vision tasks and significantly reduces energy consumption and footprint compared to traditional models like LSTMs. The work demonstrates that bio-inspired intrinsic plasticity can provide superior processing efficiency and performance for real-time applications.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes SoilScanner, a wireless sensing system that uses radio frequency signals to detect lead contamination in soil, based on how different salts affect signal propagation. It employs a machine learning model to classify soil samples into low or high lead categories with 72% accuracy. The study concludes that it is feasible to build portable and affordable lead detection devices using this wireless technology.
