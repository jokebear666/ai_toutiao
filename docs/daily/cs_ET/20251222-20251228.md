  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces M2RU, a mixed-signal hardware architecture that implements the Minion Recurrent Unit for efficient on-chip continual learning at the edge. It uses weighted-bit streaming and experience replay to enable energy-efficient temporal processing and stable adaptation. The results show significant energy efficiency improvements and a long operational lifetime, establishing M2RU as a scalable platform for edge-level temporal intelligence.
