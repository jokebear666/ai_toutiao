- **[arXiv251229] Verifiable Passkey: The Decentralized Authentication Standard**
  - **tags:** [sec], [authentication], [Verifiable Passkey, Verifiable Credential, Decentralized Identity, FIDO2]

  - **institution:** Kadir Has University, VIT-AP University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21663
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a novel 'Verifiable Passkey' standard to enable decentralized, privacy-preserving authentication. 2. Addresses the storage limitation of traditional FIDO2 passkeys by allowing a single passkey to be used across multiple services. 3. Mitigates the user tracking risk associated with centralized Identity Providers (IdPs) in federated SSO systems.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper identifies the problems of limited storage for FIDO2 passkeys and privacy risks in federated SSO. It proposes a new 'Verifiable Passkey' standard that leverages Verifiable Credentials to allow a single passkey to be used across different platforms without compromising privacy. The main conclusion is that this approach provides a decentralized, scalable, and privacy-preserving alternative to current authentication methods.
