  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes timed reward machines (TRMs), an extension of reward machines that incorporates timing constraints into the reward specification for reinforcement learning. The authors develop model-free RL algorithms, specifically using tabular Q-learning integrated with abstractions of timed automata and counterfactual-imagining heuristics, to learn optimal policies. The experimental results show that their approach successfully learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the specified timing constraints.
