- **[arXiv251229] Quantitative Verification of Omega-regular Properties in Probabilistic Programming**
  - **tags:** [other], [probabilistic programming and verification], [temporal posterior inference, omega-regular properties, stochastic barrier certificates, Rabin automata, quantitative verification]
  - **authors:** Peixin Wang, Jianhao Bai, Min Zhang, C.-H. Luke Ong
  - **institution:** East China Normal University, Nanyang Technological University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21596
  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces Temporal Posterior Inference (TPI), a new framework unifying probabilistic programming with temporal logic to compute posterior distributions over execution traces satisfying omega-regular properties. 2. Develops a novel method for computing rigorous upper and lower bounds on satisfaction probabilities by decomposing Rabin acceptance conditions and constructing sound stochastic barrier certificates. 3. Implements the approach in a prototype tool named TPInfer and demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency on a suite of benchmarks.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the limitation of standard probabilistic program inference, which fails to capture temporal behavior, by proposing Temporal Posterior Inference (TPI). TPI computes posterior distributions over program traces that satisfy omega-regular temporal specifications, using a method based on stochastic barrier certificates to provide quantitative verification bounds. The approach is implemented in the TPInfer tool and shown to be effective for inference over rich temporal properties.
