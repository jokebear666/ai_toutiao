  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes AllSky, a physically-based sky-model learned directly from captured HDR imagery to generate accurate environment maps for image-based lighting. It demonstrates that current DNN-based sky-models fail to match the photorealism and full dynamic range of physically captured imagery. The work concludes that AllSky provides intuitive user control and achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the limitations of existing models for accurate scene relighting.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces Gaussian Pixel Codec Avatars (GPiCA), a hybrid avatar representation that combines a textured triangle mesh and 3D Gaussians within a unified differentiable rendering pipeline. This approach uses neural networks to decode a facial expression code into the mesh, texture, and Gaussians, which are rendered together. The method achieves the realism of Gaussian-based avatars while maintaining the rendering efficiency of mesh-based avatars, enabling photorealistic performance on mobile devices.
