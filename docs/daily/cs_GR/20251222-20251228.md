  - **Simple LLM Summary:** LiteGE introduces a lightweight method for computing geodesic distances on 3D shapes by constructing compact shape descriptors using PCA on unsigned distance field samples. This approach eliminates the need for large neural networks, enabling significant reductions in memory usage and inference time while maintaining robustness on sparse point clouds. It also facilitates fast and accurate non-isometric shape correspondence, achieving up to 1000x speedup over state-of-the-art mesh-based methods.
