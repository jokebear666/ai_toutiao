  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces ShinyNeRF, a novel NeRF framework capable of modeling both isotropic and anisotropic specular reflections. 2. Proposes a method to jointly estimate physical surface properties (normals, tangents, specular concentration, anisotropy) by approximating outgoing radiance with a mixture of isotropic von Mises-Fisher distributions. 3.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces ShinyNeRF, a novel Neural Radiance Fields framework designed to accurately model anisotropic specular reflections, such as those on brushed metals, which previous methods struggled with. The method learns an approximation of outgoing radiance using a mixture of isotropic von Mises-Fisher distributions to jointly estimate physical surface properties. Experimental results show it achieves state-of-the-art performance and enables plausible material editing.

- **[arXiv251229] Graph Drawing Stress Model with Resistance Distances**
  - **tags:** [other], [graph drawing], [resistance distance, stress model, graph Laplacian, stochastic gradient descent, spectral embedding]
  - **authors:** Yosuke Onoue
  - **institution:** Nihon University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21901
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a new stress-based graph drawing paradigm using resistance distance instead of graph-theoretic shortest distance, which better captures global graph structure and admits an isometric embedding in Euclidean space. 2. Introduces Omega, a linear-time graph drawing algorithm that combines fast resistance distance embedding with random node-pair sampling for SGD, achieving more effective and robust optimization than pivot-based methods. 3. Establishes a practical and scalable connection between spectral graph theory and stress-based layouts, demonstrating improved neighborhood preservation and cluster faithfulness in visualizations.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper challenges the conventional use of shortest-path distances in stress-based graph drawing by proposing resistance distance as a superior alternative derived from the graph Laplacian. It introduces the Omega algorithm, which efficiently computes resistance distance embeddings and uses random sampling for SGD to produce more readable layouts with lower stress. The method effectively reveals global graph structures like clusters and maintains linear-time complexity for large networks.
