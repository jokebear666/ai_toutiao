  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces DiffTetVR, a differentiable volume rendering method for unstructured tetrahedral meshes. It addresses the limitation of prior grid-based methods by allowing optimization of mesh vertex positions and supporting local subdivision for coarse-to-fine reconstruction. The work provides an implementation and analysis but notes it is an intermediate step requiring further development to reach state-of-the-art performance.
