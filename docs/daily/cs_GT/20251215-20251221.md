  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze when to delegate decisions to an AI agent by balancing its value alignment, epistemic accuracy, and reach. It concludes that universal delegation requires near-perfect alignment, but context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment if the agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach offers a net benefit.
