  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21501
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a novel dynamic cooperative advertising optimization model for the SEA market that incorporates direct manufacturer advertising and retailer subsidies. 2. Analyzes two distinct scenarios (with and without retail competition) and provides feasible equilibrium solutions for optimal policies. 3. Investigates the impact of key factors like dynamic quality scores, gross margin, and competitor market share through numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper models cooperative advertising strategies in the search engine advertising (SEA) market using a differential game framework over a finite time horizon. It proposes an optimization model where a manufacturer can advertise directly and subsidize a retailer, analyzing scenarios with and without a competing independent retailer. The study provides equilibrium solutions and numerical insights, concluding that retail competition significantly impacts the optimal cooperative strategy and overall channel performance.

  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a novel transaction policy for a strategic user that jointly optimizes transaction broadcasting time and fee, considering observable mempools. 2. Derives optimal strategies for two user scenarios: mempool-oblivious users (with arbitrary mining interval distributions) and semi-strategic users (with Poisson fee updates). 3. Formulates a continuous-time Markov chain to model mempool dynamics and derives the optimal fee adjustment frequency for the strategic user.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates how a strategic user can optimize transaction broadcasting time and fee in blockchain systems with observable mempools and fee bumping. It analyzes optimal strategies under different user behavior models and block generation distributions (exponential for PoW, fixed for PoS). The key finding is that the strategic user should immediately increase the fee when it falls below the inclusion threshold.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper tackles the high-dimensional challenge of 3D reach-avoid differential games for UAVs by proposing a decomposition approach that splits the problem into horizontal and vertical sub-games, solves them using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis, and uses a novel tracking control to reconstruct the solution. The method is proven to maintain optimality and capture guarantees, and its effectiveness is successfully demonstrated through simulations and a physics simulator for quadrotor capture.
