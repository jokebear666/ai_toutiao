  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21501
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a novel dynamic cooperative advertising optimization model for the SEA market that incorporates direct manufacturer advertising and retailer subsidies. 2. Analyzes two distinct scenarios (with and without retail competition) and provides feasible equilibrium solutions for optimal policies. 3. Investigates the impact of key factors like dynamic quality scores, gross margin, and competitor market share through numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper models cooperative advertising strategies in the search engine advertising (SEA) market using a differential game framework over a finite time horizon. It proposes an optimization model where a manufacturer can advertise directly and subsidize a retailer, analyzing scenarios with and without a competing independent retailer. The study provides equilibrium solutions and numerical insights, concluding that retail competition significantly impacts the optimal cooperative strategy and overall channel performance.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper studies the fair allocation of indivisible goods to ensure envy-freeness up to any good (EFX). It proves that EFX allocations always exist when goods are represented as edges on a triangle-free multi-graph, and provides a computational algorithm for finding them. This result significantly expands the known conditions under which EFX allocations are guaranteed to exist for any number of agents.

  - **contributions:** 1. Proves that under a "sparse synergy" model, sparse relaxation methods can find near-optimal coalition structures in polynomial time with high probability. 2.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper studies the coalition structure generation (CSG) problem. It compares three algorithmic paradigms and proves that, under a random sparse synergy model, sparse relaxation methods can find near-optimal solutions in polynomial time, while exact methods like DP and MILP require exponential time to reach similar quality, establishing a clear anytime performance advantage for the sparse approach.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the problem of designing a truthful mechanism when the principal has no prior knowledge of agents' beliefs. It proposes the Distributionally Robust Adaptive Mechanism (DRAM), which iteratively learns beliefs and updates a robust optimization problem to minimize cost while ensuring truthfulness. The mechanism is proven to achieve optimal regret, and the framework is the first to maintain truthfulness under these general learning conditions.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21923
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a novel transaction policy for a strategic user that jointly optimizes transaction broadcasting time and fee, considering observable mempools. 2. Derives optimal strategies for two user scenarios: mempool-oblivious users (with arbitrary mining interval distributions) and semi-strategic users (with Poisson fee updates). 3. Formulates a continuous-time Markov chain to model mempool dynamics and derives the optimal fee adjustment frequency for the strategic user.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates how a strategic user can optimize transaction broadcasting time and fee in blockchain systems with observable mempools and fee bumping. It analyzes optimal strategies under different user behavior models and block generation distributions (exponential for PoW, fixed for PoS). The key finding is that the strategic user should immediately increase the fee when it falls below the inclusion threshold.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the problem of efficiently allocating a shared resource, like radio spectrum, between non-commercial incumbents and commercial users when direct monetary transfers are infeasible and both parties hold private information. The authors propose a new mechanism design framework that incorporates costly inspections to verify claims. They characterize the optimal mechanism and describe its key properties for achieving efficient allocation under these constraints.

  - **authors:** Yotam Gafni
  - **institution:** Weizmann Institute of Science
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22051
  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces the formal concept of a "self-maintaining" Social Choice Function (SCF), which is stable against being replaced by another SCF through its own voting process. 2. Proves a dynamic impossibility theorem (an "Arrow-Style" Theorem for Dynamics) showing that under i.i.d. unbiased beliefs, only dictatorships are self-maintaining. 3. Models the wisdom of the crowd effect to show how the stable size of a ruling elite decreases with economic extractiveness and improves in individual decision quality.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper studies the stability of voting rules (Social Choice Functions) in formal systems like DAOs, where the rules themselves can be voted on. It introduces the concept of a "self-maintaining" SCF and analyzes its implications for centralization. The main findings are that, under certain conditions, only dictatorial rules are stable, and the stable size of a ruling elite shrinks with a more extractive economy or better individual decision-making.
