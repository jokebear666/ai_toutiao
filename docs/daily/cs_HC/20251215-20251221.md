  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper uses a preregistered online experiment with adolescent-parent dyads to compare how relational versus transparent conversational styles in AI chatbots affect adolescents' perceptions. It finds that a relational style increases anthropomorphism, trust, and emotional closeness, and is especially preferred by socially and emotionally vulnerable adolescents, highlighting a design consideration for youth AI safety.

- **[arXiv251218] Managing Ambiguity: A Proof of Concept of Human-AI Symbiotic Sense-making based on Quantum-Inspired Cognitive Mechanism of Rogue Variable Detection**

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents a proof of concept for the LAIZA human-AI symbiotic system, which uses a quantum-inspired cognitive mechanism to detect "rogue variables" and manage ambiguity by preserving interpretive plurality and activating structured human clarification. The main conclusion is that this approach enables proactive scenario-based preparation and decisive action in VUCA environments, reframing ambiguity as a key construct for organizational resilience.

- **[arXiv251218] Exploring User Acceptance and Concerns toward LLM-powered Conversational Agents in Immersive Extended Reality**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [crowdsourcing, user study, extended reality, conversational agents, privacy, technology acceptance model]

  - **institution:** Technical University of Munich
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15343
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing study with 1036 participants to explore user acceptance and concerns regarding LLM-powered conversational agents in Extended Reality (XR). The study found that while users generally accept these technologies, they express significant concerns about security, privacy, social implications, and trust, with location data being the most sensitive. The results highlight the importance of practitioner transparency and that familiarity with generative AI increases acceptance, while prior XR device ownership is linked to lower acceptance.

- **[arXiv251218] Intent-Driven UAM Rescheduling**
  - **tags:** [ai], [scheduling optimization], [Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), Answer Set Programming (ASP), three-valued logic, decision tree, Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP)]
  - **authors:** Jeongseok Kim, Kangjin Kim
  - **institution:** Cleverplant, Chodang University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15462
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes an intent-driven rescheduling system for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) that combines Answer Set Programming (ASP) with Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to handle ambiguous human requests. It uses a three-valued logic and a decision tree to interpret vague user intents for transparent schedule adjustments. The main conclusion is that this integrated framework provides a robust, explainable, and adaptive structure for UAM scheduling.
