  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15117
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper uses a preregistered online experiment with adolescent-parent dyads to compare how relational versus transparent conversational styles in AI chatbots affect adolescents' perceptions. It finds that a relational style increases anthropomorphism, trust, and emotional closeness, and is especially preferred by socially and emotionally vulnerable adolescents, highlighting a design consideration for youth AI safety.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents a proof of concept for the LAIZA human-AI symbiotic system, which uses a quantum-inspired cognitive mechanism to detect "rogue variables" and manage ambiguity by preserving interpretive plurality and activating structured human clarification. The main conclusion is that this approach enables proactive scenario-based preparation and decisive action in VUCA environments, reframing ambiguity as a key construct for organizational resilience.

- **[arXiv251218] Exploring User Acceptance and Concerns toward LLM-powered Conversational Agents in Immersive Extended Reality**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [crowdsourcing, user study, extended reality, conversational agents, privacy, technology acceptance model]
  - **authors:** Efe Bozkir, Enkelejda Kasneci
  - **institution:** Technical University of Munich
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15343
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing study with 1036 participants to explore user acceptance and concerns regarding LLM-powered conversational agents in Extended Reality (XR). The study found that while users generally accept these technologies, they express significant concerns about security, privacy, social implications, and trust, with location data being the most sensitive. The results highlight the importance of practitioner transparency and that familiarity with generative AI increases acceptance, while prior XR device ownership is linked to lower acceptance.

  - **authors:** Qidi Xu, Nuzha Amjad, Grace Giles, Alexa Cumming, De'angelo Hermesky, Alexander Wen, Min Ji Kwak, Yejin Kim
  - **institution:** UTHealth Houston, University of Texas Health Sciences Center Houston
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16063
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces CoTI, a multi-agent LLM framework with three specialized agents to automate qualitative thematic analysis of patient interviews. The framework was applied to heart failure patient data and produced results more aligned with a senior investigator's analysis than with junior investigators or baseline NLP models. However, collaboration between the AI and junior investigators showed limited gains, suggesting a risk of over-reliance that may hinder independent critical thinking.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16083
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces GRAST-SQL, a framework for scaling Text2SQL systems by efficiently filtering and compacting database schemas before prompting an LLM. It uses a query-aware LLM encoder, a graph transformer over functional dependencies, and a Steiner-tree heuristic to select a relevant, connectivity-preserving sub-schema. The method achieves high recall and precision while maintaining low latency and scaling to schemas with over 23,000 columns.

HMATr leverages memory banks to preserve historical context and uses learnable queries to encode gesture positions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.6% in detection rate.

- **[arXiv251219] Plausibility as Failure: How LLMs and Humans Co-Construct Epistemic Error**
  - **tags:** [ai], [human-ai interaction], [human evaluation, epistemic failure, plausibility, hermeneutic error, co-construction, verification burden, cognitive drift]
  - **authors:** Claudia Vale Oliveira, Nelson Zagalo, Filipe Silva, Anabela Brandao, Syeda Faryal Hussain Khurrum, Joaquim Santos
  - **institution:** University of Aveiro
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16750
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper uses a multi-round, multi-LLM evaluation with interdisciplinary tasks to study how humans interpret model responses. It concludes that LLM errors are co-constructed through model-generated plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts, shifting error analysis from predictive metrics to a relational, hermeneutic process.

- **[arXiv251219] PrivateXR: Defending Privacy Attacks in Extended Reality Through Explainable AI-Guided Differential Privacy**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [explainable AI, differential privacy, membership inference attack, re-identification attack, post-hoc explanations, feature selection, transformer models]
  - **authors:** Ripan Kumar Kundu, Istiak Ahmed, Khaza Anuarul Hoque
  - **institution:** University of Missouri-Columbia
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16851
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes a framework that uses explainable AI (XAI) to identify the most influential features in AI-XR models and selectively applies differential privacy (DP) to those features during inference to defend against privacy attacks. This XAI-guided DP approach reduces the success rates of membership inference and re-identification attacks while preserving model accuracy and improving inference time compared to traditional DP. The method is deployed as a system called PrivateXR on an HTC VIVE Pro headset, allowing users to adjust privacy levels in real-time during XR gameplay.
