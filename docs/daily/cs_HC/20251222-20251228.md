- **[arXiv251222] Adversarial VR: An Open-Source Testbed for Evaluating Adversarial Robustness of VR Cybersickness Detection and Mitigation**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [adversarial attacks, deep learning, cybersickness detection, visual tunneling, MI-FGSM, PGD, C&W, DeepTCN, Transformer]
  - **authors:** Istiak Ahmed, Ripan Kumar Kundu, Khaza Anuarul Hoque

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces Adversarial-VR, an open-source Unity testbed that integrates DeepTCN and Transformer models for real-time cybersickness detection and mitigation, and evaluates their robustness against adversarial attacks like MI-FGSM, PGD, and C&W. The results show these attacks can successfully fool the system, significantly degrading model accuracy and preventing correct mitigation.

- **[arXiv251222] Bots Don't Sit Still: A Longitudinal Study of Bot Behaviour Change, Temporal Drift, and Feature-Structure Evolution**
  - **tags:** [ai], [social media analysis], [Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, KPSS test, Spearman correlation, Chi-square test, time series analysis, stationarity testing]
  - **authors:** Ohoud Alzahrani, Russell Beale, Bob Hendley
  - **institution:** University of Birmingham
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17067
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper conducts a longitudinal study analyzing the temporal behavior of promotional Twitter bots using time series analysis and statistical tests on ten content-based meta-features. It finds that bot behavior is non-stationary, with individual features and their interdependencies evolving systematically over time and across bot generations. The conclusion is that bot-detection systems must account for this dynamic adaptation and avoid treating behavioral features as static.

- **[arXiv251222] PILAR: Personalizing Augmented Reality Interactions with LLM-based Human-Centric and Trustworthy Explanations for Daily Use Cases**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [large language model, explainable ai, augmented reality, personalized explanations, real-time object detection, user study]
  - **authors:** Ripan Kumar Kundu, Istiak Ahmed, Khaza Anuarul Hoque
  - **institution:** University of Missouri-Columbia
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17172

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes PILAR, a framework that uses a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to generate unified, context-aware, and personalized explanations for AI-driven augmented reality systems. A user study on a recipe recommendation prototype showed that the LLM-based explanation interface significantly improved user task performance and perceived transparency compared to a traditional template-based approach.

- **[arXiv251222] Learning Spatio-Temporal Feature Representations for Video-Based Gaze Estimation**
  - **tags:** [ai], [computer vision], [spatio-temporal feature representation, channel attention, self-attention, recurrent neural networks, video-based gaze estimation]
  - **authors:** Alexandre Personnic, Mihai Bâce
  - **institution:** KU Leuven
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17673
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), which combines a CNN backbone with channel and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features, then models intra- and inter-frame dynamics by treating features as a spatial sequence propagated through time. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EVE dataset, demonstrating that preserving intra-frame spatial context is superior to premature spatial pooling for robust video-based gaze estimation.

- **[arXiv251222] ShareChat: A Dataset of Chatbot Conversations in the Wild**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [dataset collection, multi-turn conversations, platform affordances, source citations, temporal analysis, cross-platform corpus]
  - **authors:** Yueru Yan, Tuc Nguyen, Bo Su, Melissa Lieffers, Thai Le
  - **institution:** Indiana University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17843
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces ShareChat, a large-scale dataset of real-world chatbot conversations collected from five major platforms, preserving interface-specific features like reasoning traces and source links. It demonstrates the dataset's utility through analyses of user intent satisfaction, citation behaviors, and evolving usage patterns, providing a resource for studying authentic user-LLM interactions.

- **[arXiv251222] Integrating Computational Methods and AI into Qualitative Studies of Aging and Later Life**
  - **tags:** [ai], [computational social science], [computational text analysis, machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), ethnography, in-depth interviews, mixed-methods]
  - **authors:** Corey M. Abramson
  - **institution:** Rice University, UC San Francisco
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17850
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper demonstrates how computational social science tools like machine learning and natural language processing can be integrated with traditional qualitative methods (e.g., ethnography, interviews) to study aging. It concludes that these computational methods can broaden qualitative research by streamlining workflows, scaling up projects, and enabling new multi-method insights, rather than replacing its foundational approaches.
