- **[arXiv251218] Where to Explore: A Reach and Cost-Aware Approach for Unbiased Data Collection in Recommender Systems**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [A/B testing, cost-aware optimization, scroll-depth analysis, unbiased data collection, dedicated exploration container]
  - **authors:** Qiang Chen, Venkatesh Ganapati Hegde
  - **institution:** Tubi
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14733
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces a method for safe content exploration in recommender systems by strategically placing a "Something Completely Different" row of randomized content only in low-engagement, high-reach scroll-depth regions of the UI. This approach preserves key business metrics while collecting unbiased interaction data. The collected data, when used for downstream candidate generation, significantly improves user engagement.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper improves a pipeline for analyzing political viewpoints in news by fine-tuning Large Language Models for classification and enriching claim representations with semantic actor descriptions from Wikidata. The integrated approach, evaluated on UK immigration debate data, shows that combining fine-tuned LLMs with knowledge graph context yields the best performance, particularly with models capable of processing long inputs.

- **[arXiv251218] Topological Metric for Unsupervised Embedding Quality Evaluation**
  - **tags:** [ai], [representation learning evaluation], [persistent homology, unsupervised metric, topological data analysis, embedding quality]

  - **institution:** Sber AI Laboratory
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15285
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes "Persistence", a fully unsupervised metric for evaluating embedding quality based on persistent homology from topological data analysis. It captures the multi-scale geometric and topological structure of embedding spaces. Empirical results show it achieves strong correlation with downstream task performance, outperforming existing unsupervised metrics.

- **[arXiv251218] Image Complexity-Aware Adaptive Retrieval for Efficient Vision-Language Models**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [multi-modal inference], [adaptive computation, early exit, dual-path training, image complexity classification, ConvNeXt-IC]
  - **authors:** Mikel Williams-Lekuona, Georgina Cosma
  - **institution:** Loughborough University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15372
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes ICAR, an adaptive retrieval method that reduces computation for simple images in vision-language models by using early exits, while maintaining cross-modal alignment through dual-path training. It also introduces ConvNeXt-IC, a classifier for image complexity to decide the compute depth. The method achieves a 20% practical speedup with minimal performance loss, enabling more efficient scaling of vision-language systems.

- **[arXiv251218] BERT and CNN integrated Neural Collaborative Filtering for Recommender Systems**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [neural collaborative filtering, BERT, CNN, hybrid recommendation system, deep learning]

  - **institution:** East West University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15526
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a hybrid neural collaborative filtering (NCF) model that integrates BERT and CNN to process categorical and image data for recommendations. The model was trained on a MovieLens dataset and outperformed baseline NCF and BERT-based NCF models. The results show that incorporating both categorical and image data can improve recommendation system performance.
