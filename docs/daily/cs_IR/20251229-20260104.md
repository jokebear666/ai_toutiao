  - **institution:** Shanghai Customs College, Anhui University of Finance and Economics
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21501
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a novel dynamic cooperative advertising optimization model for the SEA market that incorporates direct manufacturer advertising and retailer subsidies. 2. Analyzes two distinct scenarios (with and without retail competition) and provides feasible equilibrium solutions for optimal policies. 3.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper models cooperative advertising strategies in the search engine advertising (SEA) market using a differential game framework over a finite time horizon. It proposes an optimization model where a manufacturer can advertise directly and subsidize a retailer, analyzing scenarios with and without a competing independent retailer. The study provides equilibrium solutions and numerical insights, concluding that retail competition significantly impacts the optimal cooperative strategy and overall channel performance.

- **[arXiv251229] Selective LLM-Guided Regularization for Enhancing Recommendation Models**
  - **tags:** [ai], [recommender systems], [selective regularization, knowledge distillation, cold-start, long-tail, gating mechanism]
  - **authors:** Shanglin Yang, Zhan Shi
  - **institution:** Sichuan University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21526
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a selective LLM-guided regularization framework (S-LLMR) that activates LLM supervision only when a gating mechanism predicts the LLM to be reliable, addressing the issue of inaccurate global distillation. 2. Introduces a trainable gating mechanism informed by user history length, item popularity, and model uncertainty to dynamically decide when to apply LLM-based pairwise ranking supervision. 3. Demonstrates through experiments that the method improves overall accuracy and yields substantial gains in cold-start and long-tail recommendation scenarios, outperforming global distillation baselines.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper addresses the problem of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for recommendation without suffering from their high cost and unreliability in certain scenarios. It proposes Selective LLM-Guided Regularization (S-LLMR), a model-agnostic framework that uses a gating mechanism to selectively apply LLM-based supervision only when the LLM is predicted to be reliable. Experiments show this approach improves recommendation accuracy, especially for cold-start users and long-tail items, outperforming methods that uniformly distill LLM knowledge.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes CEMG, a novel generative recommendation framework that addresses superficial collaborative signal integration and decoupled multimodal fusion. It uses collaborative signals to guide multimodal feature fusion, tokenizes the fused representation into discrete codes using an RQ-VAE, and fine-tunes an LLM to generate these codes. Experiments show CEMG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

- **[arXiv251229] Frozen LVLMs for Micro-Video Recommendation: A Systematic Study of Feature Extraction and Fusion**
  - **tags:** [ai], [recommender systems], [frozen large video language models, micro-video recommendation, feature fusion, intermediate hidden states, dual feature fusion]
  - **authors:** Huatuan Sun, Yunshan Ma, Changguang Wu, Yanxin Zhang, Pengfei Wang, Xiaoyu Du
  - **institution:** Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Singapore Management University, University of Wisconsin-Madison, GienTech Technology Co., Ltd.
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21863
  - **contributions:** 1. Conducted the first systematic empirical study on integrating frozen LVLMs into micro-video recommendation, evaluating feature extraction paradigms (captions vs. hidden states) and integration strategies (replacement vs. fusion) with ID embeddings. 2. Derived three key principles: intermediate hidden states outperform captions, ID embeddings are irreplaceable (fusion > replacement), and the effectiveness of hidden states varies across layers. 3. Proposed the Dual Feature Fusion (DFF) Framework, a lightweight plug-and-play method that adaptively fuses multi-layer LVLM representations with ID embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper systematically studies how to best integrate frozen Large Video-Language Models (LVLMs) as feature extractors for micro-video recommendation. It finds that using intermediate decoder hidden states and fusing them with item ID embeddings is superior to using generated captions or replacing IDs. Based on these insights, the authors propose the Dual Feature Fusion (DFF) framework, which achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.
