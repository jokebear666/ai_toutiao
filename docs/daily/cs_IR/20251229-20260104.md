  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper models cooperative advertising strategies in the search engine advertising (SEA) market using a differential game framework over a finite time horizon. It proposes an optimization model where a manufacturer can advertise directly and subsidize a retailer, analyzing scenarios with and without a competing independent retailer. The study provides equilibrium solutions and numerical insights, concluding that retail competition significantly impacts the optimal cooperative strategy and overall channel performance.

  - **tags:** [ai], [recommender systems], [selective regularization, knowledge distillation, cold-start, long-tail, gating mechanism]
  - **authors:** Shanglin Yang, Zhan Shi
  - **institution:** Sichuan University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21526
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a selective LLM-guided regularization framework (S-LLMR) that activates LLM supervision only when a gating mechanism predicts the LLM to be reliable, addressing the issue of inaccurate global distillation. 2. Introduces a trainable gating mechanism informed by user history length, item popularity, and model uncertainty to dynamically decide when to apply LLM-based pairwise ranking supervision. 3. Demonstrates through experiments that the method improves overall accuracy and yields substantial gains in cold-start and long-tail recommendation scenarios, outperforming global distillation baselines.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper addresses the problem of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for recommendation without suffering from their high cost and unreliability in certain scenarios. It proposes Selective LLM-Guided Regularization (S-LLMR), a model-agnostic framework that uses a gating mechanism to selectively apply LLM-based supervision only when the LLM is predicted to be reliable. Experiments show this approach improves recommendation accuracy, especially for cold-start users and long-tail items, outperforming methods that uniformly distill LLM knowledge.

  - **tags:** [ai], [recommender systems], [frozen large video language models, micro-video recommendation, feature fusion, intermediate hidden states, dual feature fusion]
  - **authors:** Huatuan Sun, Yunshan Ma, Changguang Wu, Yanxin Zhang, Pengfei Wang, Xiaoyu Du
  - **institution:** Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Singapore Management University, University of Wisconsin-Madison, GienTech Technology Co., Ltd.
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21863
  - **contributions:** 1. Conducted the first systematic empirical study on integrating frozen LVLMs into micro-video recommendation, evaluating feature extraction paradigms (captions vs. hidden states) and integration strategies (replacement vs. fusion) with ID embeddings. 2. Derived three key principles: intermediate hidden states outperform captions, ID embeddings are irreplaceable (fusion > replacement), and the effectiveness of hidden states varies across layers. 3. Proposed the Dual Feature Fusion (DFF) Framework, a lightweight plug-and-play method that adaptively fuses multi-layer LVLM representations with ID embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
