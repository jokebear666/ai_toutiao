  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes a multi-modal semantic communication framework that uses text-based user queries and a cross-modal attention mechanism to guide the extraction and adaptive-resolution transmission of task-relevant image patches. This approach overcomes limitations of self-attention-only methods in complex scenes and enables flexible, efficient communication under bandwidth constraints.
