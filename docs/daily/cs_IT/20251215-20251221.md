  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes a multi-modal semantic communication framework that uses text-based user queries and a cross-modal attention mechanism to guide the extraction and adaptive-resolution transmission of task-relevant image patches. This approach overcomes limitations of self-attention-only methods in complex scenes and enables flexible, efficient communication under bandwidth constraints.

- **[arXiv251219] Time-Frequency Analysis for Neural Networks**
  - **tags:** [ai], [approximation theory], [time-frequency analysis, modulation spaces, Sobolev norms, shallow neural networks, Barron spaces]
  - **authors:** Ahmed Abdeljawad, Elena Cordero
  - **institution:** Johann Radon Institute of Computational and Applied Mathematics (RICAM), Austrian Academy of Sciences; Università degli Studi di Torino
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15992
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper develops a quantitative approximation theory for shallow neural networks using time-frequency analysis and weighted modulation spaces. It proves dimension-independent approximation rates in Sobolev norms for networks combining standard activations with localized time-frequency windows, achieving better performance than standard ReLU networks.

- **[arXiv251219] Information theory and discriminative sampling for model discovery**
  - **tags:** [ai], [dynamical systems], [Fisher Information Matrix, SINDy, sparse identification, bagging, entropy]
  - **authors:** Yuxuan Bao, J. Nathan Kutz
  - **institution:** University of Washington
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16000
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper uses the Fisher Information Matrix within the SINDy framework to quantify the information content in different segments of dynamical system trajectories. It demonstrates that prioritizing more informative data through information-theoretic metrics improves sampling efficiency and model performance in data-driven model discovery.

- **[arXiv251219] Large Model Enabled Embodied Intelligence for 6G Integrated Perception, Communication, and Computation Network**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [multi-modal inference], [integrated perception communication computation, cloud-edge-end collaboration, parameter-efficient adaptation, multimodal fusion, intelligent base station agent, large AI model]
  - **authors:** Zhuoran Li, Zhen Gao, Xinhua Liu, Zheng Wang, Xiaotian Zhou, Lei Liu, Yongpeng Wu, Wei Feng, Yongming Huang
  - **institution:** Beijing Institute of Technology
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15109
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes using Large AI Models (LAMs) to transform base stations into Intelligent Base Station Agents (IBSAs) for 6G networks, integrating perception, communication, and computation. The core method involves a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. The main conclusion is that LAM-enabled IBSAs represent a practical path toward building native, safety-critical 6G systems.

- **[arXiv251219] Non-Linear Strong Data-Processing for Quantum Hockey-Stick Divergences**
  - **tags:** [ai], [quantum information theory], [strong data-processing inequalities, hockey-stick divergence, quantum channels, contraction coefficients, Fγ curves, reverse-Pinsker inequalities]
  - **authors:** Theshani Nuradha, Ian George, Christoph Hirche
  - **institution:** University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, National University of Singapore, Leibniz Universität Hannover
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16778
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper establishes non-linear strong data-processing inequalities (SDPI) for quantum hockey-stick divergences, improving upon existing linear bounds. The method involves defining Fγ curves to characterize SDPI for sequential compositions of noisy quantum channels. The results enable tighter finite mixing time bounds and stronger privacy guarantees for sequential private quantum channels.
