Deriving two novel, tighter theoretical bounds (Pinsker-Marginal and Mixed) on the approximation error in off-policy LLM-RL, scaling better with sequence length than classical O(T^2) bounds. 2. Identifying that these bounds depend on a sequence-level quantity (maximum token-level KL divergence) that cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. 3. Proposing the Trust Region Masking (TRM) algorithm, which masks entire sequences from gradient updates to enforce the trust region, providing non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon tasks.

  - **institution:** Fudan University, Peking University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23506
  - **contributions:** 1. Provides a geometric interpretation of the PLV algorithm by analyzing it in a weighted Fourier-domain, leading to an explicit trigonometric-polynomial representation. 2. Derives a closed-form solution via a positive-definite matrix, which guarantees uniqueness of the recovered APS. 3. Establishes an exact energy identity that characterizes the reconstruction error and provides a sharp identifiability condition: perfect recovery occurs if and only if the true APS lies within the identified subspace; otherwise, PLV returns the minimum-energy consistent spectrum.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the problem of recovering a continuous angular power spectrum (APS) from a spatial channel covariance matrix. It builds upon the Projection onto Linear Variety (PLV) algorithm, analyzing it in a weighted Fourier-domain to enhance geometric interpretability, which yields a closed-form solution and a sharp characterization of identifiability and resolution. The main conclusion is that PLV achieves perfect recovery only when the true APS lies in a specific trigonometric-polynomial subspace; otherwise, it returns the minimum-energy spectrum consistent with the covariance.

  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes an active, nonparametric sequential two-sample testing procedure for multiple heterogeneous data sources, which works under minimal distributional assumptions., 2. Introduces an adaptive source-selection strategy that mixes exploitation (based on empirical distinguishability) and exploration (via a vanishing greedy strategy) within the testing-by-betting framework., 3. Theoretically establishes that the test controls type-I error, has power-one under the alternative, and provides a bound on expected sample size, characterizing the improvement over passive sampling.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper addresses the problem of active, sequential two-sample testing across multiple heterogeneous data sources where distributions are nonparametric. It proposes a method that adaptively selects data sources using an explore-exploit strategy and updates a betting wealth martingale to make decisions. The main conclusion is that this approach controls type-I error, ensures power-one detection, and achieves faster decisions compared to passive testing, quantifying the gains of adaptive sampling.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a method to optimize a Flexible Intelligent Metasurface (FIM) for downlink communications using only statistical Channel State Information (CSI), rather than instantaneous CSI. The method involves deriving the FIM's spatial correlation matrix and applying a gradient projection-based algorithm to maximize the average sum spectral efficiency. Simulation results show the FIM-aided system provides significant performance gains over rigid antenna arrays in scenarios with strong spatial channel correlation.
