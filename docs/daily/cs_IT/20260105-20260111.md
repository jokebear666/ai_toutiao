- **[arXiv260105] The permutation group of Reed-Solomon codes over arbitrary points**
  - **tags:** [other], [coding theory], [Reed-Solomon codes, permutation group, automorphism group, affine permutations, evaluation points]
  - **authors:** Eduardo Camps-Moreno, Jun Bo Lau, Hiram H. López, Welington Santos
  - **institution:** Virginia Tech, KU Leuven, University of Wisconsin-Stout
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00122
  - **contributions:** 1. Proves that the permutation group of a Reed-Solomon code is precisely the set of degree-one polynomials (affine permutations) that leave its set of evaluation points invariant. 2. Provides a straightforward, elementary algebraic proof for this characterization, applicable to arbitrary evaluation sets. 3.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper studies the permutation group (automorphism group) of Reed-Solomon codes. It proves that this group consists exactly of the affine permutations (polynomials of degree one) that map the code's evaluation set to itself. This result provides a simple, unified proof for previously known special cases and clarifies the structure of the code's symmetries for arbitrary evaluation points.

  - **institution:** University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00337
  - **contributions:** 1.

Introduced a quantum moments accountant based on an operator-valued notion of privacy loss and a matrix moment-generating function for tensor-product channels on product neighboring inputs. 3. Proved that controlling the moments of their defined Rényi-type divergence suffices to bound measured Rényi divergence, yielding advanced-composition-style bounds with the same leading-order behavior as classical theory.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents three theoretical results in algebraic coding theory concerning codes derived from group algebras. It solves an open problem about the checkability of twisted skew group codes, generalizes a classification result for 3-dimensional ideals, and establishes a new bound on code parameters. The work advances the mathematical understanding of twisted and skew group codes.
