- **[arXiv251229] A Note on the NP-Hardness of PARTITION Via First-Order Projections**
  - **tags:** [other], [computational complexity theory], [NP-hardness, first-order reductions, AC0 reductions, PARTITION problem, descriptive complexity]
  - **authors:** Paúl Risco Iturralde
  - **institution:** Independent researcher
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21448
  - **contributions:** 1. Demonstrates NP-hardness of the PARTITION problem via first-order projections, 2. Overcomes the obstacle of requiring large sums in the standard reduction by using descriptive complexity techniques, 3. Fills a gap in the literature regarding the hardness of PARTITION under restricted reductions like AC0.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This note addresses the open question of whether the PARTITION problem is NP-hard under restricted reductions like AC0. It modifies classic reductions from 3SAT to SUBSET-SUM to PARTITION, defining them using first-order logical formulas (first-order projections). The main conclusion is that PARTITION is indeed NP-hard via first-order projections, which implies hardness under polynomial-size AC0 reductions, thereby resolving the gap mentioned in prior work.

  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces Temporal Posterior Inference (TPI), a new framework unifying probabilistic programming with temporal logic to compute posterior distributions over execution traces satisfying omega-regular properties. 2.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the limitation of standard probabilistic program inference, which fails to capture temporal behavior, by proposing Temporal Posterior Inference (TPI). TPI computes posterior distributions over program traces that satisfy omega-regular temporal specifications, using a method based on stochastic barrier certificates to provide quantitative verification bounds. The approach is implemented in the TPInfer tool and shown to be effective for inference over rich temporal properties.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates the relationship between tractable first-order (FO) logic model checking and the graph parameter twin-width for specific geometric graph classes. It answers open questions by proving this equivalence (delineation) holds for intersection graphs of axis-parallel unit segments and circular arcs, but fails for visibility graphs of 1.5D terrains. The work leverages the theory of twin-width for ordered graphs, exploiting natural vertex orderings in geometric representations.

  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces FOLHyper, a tool for automatically checking the satisfiability of hyperproperties specified in HyperLTL. 2. Reduces the HyperLTL satisfiability problem to an equisatisfiable first-order logic formula, enabling the use of standard FOL solvers. 3. Extends applicability beyond the decidable ∃*∀* fragment of HyperLTL and is shown to be particularly effective at proving unsatisfiability, complementing existing bounded methods.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the problem of checking the satisfiability of hyperproperties, which are crucial for security and information-flow specifications. It proposes FOLHyper, a tool that translates HyperLTL formulas into equisatisfiable first-order logic formulas, allowing the use of FOL solvers for analysis. The method extends beyond known decidable fragments and is shown to be effective, especially for proving unsatisfiability.

  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a novel game-based approach for verifying arbitrary ∀∗∃∗ formulas in Asynchronous HyperLTL (A-HLTL) in reactive systems. 2. Interprets verification as a game between a verifier and refuter, where a winning strategy provides witnesses for traces and asynchronous alignments for stutterings. 3. Identifies fragments for which the game-based interpretation is complete, providing a finite-state decision procedure, and contributes a prototype implementation with encouraging experimental results.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the challenge of model-checking asynchronous hyperproperties in reactive systems, which require comparing execution traces across different timesteps. It proposes a novel game-based verification method for a logic called Asynchronous HyperLTL (A-HLTL), interpreting the problem as a two-player game to find suitable trace stutterings. The approach provides a decision procedure for certain formula fragments and is supported by a prototype implementation.

  - **contributions:** 1. Proved polynomial-time reducibility of propositional logics to their fragments with at most two variables. 2. Established reducibility of predicate logics to fragments with limited predicate letters and individual variables, with conditions and counterexamples. 3. Provided new complexity bounds, Kripke-incompleteness results, and analogues of Church and Trakhtenbrot theorems for quasiary predicate logic.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This work investigates the algorithmic complexity of non-classical logics. It demonstrates that many propositional and predicate logics can be reduced to simpler, smaller fragments, establishing conditions for such reductions and providing counterexamples. The results include new complexity bounds and fundamental incompleteness theorems for these logical systems.
