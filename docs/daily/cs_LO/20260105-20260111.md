  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes exploiting structural sparsity (via the variable dependency graph's treewidth) to mitigate the high complexity of quantifier elimination., 2. Develops a novel dynamic programming framework structured over a tree decomposition for applying FME and CAD., 3. Proves that when treewidth is constant, the framework reduces the worst-case complexity from doubly exponential to single exponential for both FME and CAD.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the high complexity of quantifier elimination (QE) procedures like Fourier-Motzkin elimination (FME) and cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD). It proposes a new dynamic programming framework that leverages the low treewidth of the variable dependency graph to structure the elimination process. The key result is that for constant treewidth, the method achieves an exponential improvement, reducing worst-case complexity from doubly exponential to single exponential, which is validated by preliminary experiments on sparse benchmarks.

  - **contributions:** 1. Introduced a training-free method for detecting valid mathematical reasoning in LLMs by performing spectral analysis on attention matrices treated as dynamic graphs. 2. Identified four interpretable spectral diagnostics (Fiedler value, HFER, smoothness, entropy) that show significant statistical differences between valid and invalid proofs across multiple model families. 3. Discovered that the method captures logical coherence rather than formal verifier acceptance and revealed an architectural dependency where different attention mechanisms (e.g., Sliding Window Attention) shift the primary discriminative spectral feature.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes a training-free method to detect valid mathematical reasoning in large language models by analyzing the spectral properties of attention patterns. The method identifies key spectral signatures that effectively distinguish between valid and invalid proofs with high accuracy. The findings show the method captures logical coherence and its effectiveness depends on the model's attention architecture.
