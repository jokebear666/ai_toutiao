  - **Simple LLM Summary:** V-Agent is a multi-agent video search system that fine-tunes a vision-language model with a small video preference dataset and enhances it with a retrieval vector to embed video frames and audio transcriptions into a shared multimodal space. It uses three agents—routing, search, and chat—to refine searches and interact with users, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16970
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces PAACE, a framework for compressing the expanding context of LLM agents in multi-step workflows. It uses plan-aware techniques like next-k-task relevance modeling and function-preserving compression, trained on synthetic data and distilled into efficient models. The method improves agent accuracy while significantly reducing context load and inference costs.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a multi-agent system architecture that integrates Transactional Analysis theory, dividing each agent into Parent, Adult, and Child ego states, and enhances their responses with contextual information retrieval from vector stores. The system is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario. The results show that this psychologically grounded structure improves the realism of LLM-based agent behavior.

- **[arXiv251222] DiffeoMorph: Learning to Morph 3D Shapes Using Differentiable Agent-Based Simulations**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [differentiable simulation, graph neural network, SE(3)-equivariance, attention mechanism, 3D Zernike polynomials, shape-matching loss, implicit differentiation, bilevel optimization]

  - **institution:** Harvard University, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17129
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces DiffeoMorph, a differentiable framework that uses an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network to train agents to collectively morph into target 3D shapes. It employs a novel shape-matching loss based on 3D Zernike polynomials and uses implicit differentiation to handle a bilevel optimization problem for rotation alignment. The method successfully generates complex shapes from simple ellipsoids using minimal spatial cues.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a Verifiability-First architecture for LLM-based agents, integrating runtime attestations, lightweight audit agents for continuous verification, and challenge-response protocols for high-risk operations. It introduces the OPERA benchmark to evaluate the detectability and speed of remediation for misaligned behavior, shifting the focus from measuring the propensity for misalignment to ensuring reliable detection and control.
