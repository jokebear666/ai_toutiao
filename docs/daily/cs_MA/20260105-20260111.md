  - **contributions:** 1. A formal Resource-Constrained Agent Communication (RCAC) model for reasoning about expressiveness vs. resource trade-offs. 2.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes μACP, a formal calculus for agent communication designed to operate under severe resource constraints like those in edge and IoT environments. It proves that a minimal set of four communication verbs is sufficient to encode expressive protocols and establishes theoretical bounds on message complexity, achieving low latency in simulations. The main contribution is a unified framework that reconciles semantic richness with provable efficiency for resource-constrained multi-agent systems.

  - **institution:** Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Korea Military Academy (KMA), University of California, Riverside (UCR)
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00580
  - **contributions:** 1. Formally defines the Priority-Aware Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (PA-MCPP) problem, introducing priority weights and a lexicographic objective to minimize priority-weighted latency and makespan. 2. Proposes a scalable two-phase framework combining greedy zone assignment with local search and Steiner-tree-guided residual coverage. 3. Demonstrates through experiments that the method significantly reduces priority-weighted latency compared to baselines while maintaining competitive makespan and scales well with the number of robots.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper addresses the limitation of standard multi-robot coverage path planning, which treats all areas equally, by introducing a priority-aware version (PA-MCPP) where certain zones have higher urgency. The authors propose a two-phase method that first assigns and covers priority zones efficiently and then handles the remaining area. Experiments show their approach successfully reduces coverage delay for high-priority zones without significantly compromising the overall completion time.
