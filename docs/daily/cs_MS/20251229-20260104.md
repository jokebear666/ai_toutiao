  - **contributions:** 1. Identified a new statistical failure in the widely-used MT19937 PRNG using a natural run-length distribution test. 2. Provided a mathematical theorem explaining the observed anomalies, linking them to the sparseness of a specific matrix in the generator's recursion. 3. Demonstrated that while the defect is theoretically significant, detecting it in practice requires an astronomical number of samples, thus assessing its practical severity.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper reports a new statistical flaw in the Mersenne Twister MT19937 pseudorandom number generator, where the distribution of run-lengths for identical 32-bit integers shows a significant anomaly (e.g., run-length 623 appears ~40 times more than expected). The authors mathematically analyze and prove that this failure is caused by the sparseness of a specific matrix in the generator's recurrence. They conclude that while this is a theoretical defect, its practical impact is minimal due to the extreme difficulty of detection.
