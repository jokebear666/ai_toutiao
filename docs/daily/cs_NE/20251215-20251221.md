  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces SGEMAS, a bio-inspired multi-agent system that uses agent birth/death and a variational free energy objective to achieve energy-efficient, unsupervised anomaly detection in physiological signals. It validates the approach on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, showing that this physics-based, energy-constrained model can detect anomalies in a zero-shot setting, outperforming a standard autoencoder baseline.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes Q-MetaSur, a plug-and-play surrogate modeling scheme that uses a Large Language Model as a sequence-to-sequence surrogate for offline multi-task multi-objective optimization, trained with a two-stage strategy combining supervised tuning and RL fine-tuning. The method demonstrates superior objective approximation accuracy and helps evolutionary algorithms achieve better convergence and Pareto optimality on benchmark problems.
