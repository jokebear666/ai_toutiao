- **[arXiv251223] Modality-Dependent Memory Mechanisms in Cross-Modal Neuromorphic Computing**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [multi-modal training], [spiking neural networks, Hopfield networks, Hierarchical Gated Recurrent Networks, supervised contrastive learning, cross-modal ablation study, engram analysis]
  - **authors:** Effiong Blessing, Chiung-Yi Tseng, Somshubhra Roy, Junaid Rehman, Isaac Nkrumah
  - **institution:** Saint Louis University, Luxmuse AI, North Carolina State University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18575
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper conducts a cross-modal ablation study of memory mechanisms in spiking neural networks (SNNs), evaluating Hopfield networks, HGRNs, and supervised contrastive learning on visual and auditory neuromorphic datasets. It finds that memory mechanisms exhibit strong modality-specific specialization rather than universal applicability, with Hopfield networks excelling on visual tasks but performing poorly on auditory ones. The work provides empirical evidence for modality-specific memory optimization in neuromorphic systems, achieving significant energy efficiency.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper benchmarks 65 multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms on a bi-objective redundancy allocation problem for repairable systems, using continuous-time Markov chains to evaluate system availability. The study finds that algorithm performance is highly budget-dependent and that a Scaled Binomial Initialization (SBI) significantly improves results, with NSGAIIARSBX-SBI performing well for larger budgets. The Pareto-optimal solutions are dominated by hot standby and mixed redundancy strategies, especially when more spare components are allowed.
