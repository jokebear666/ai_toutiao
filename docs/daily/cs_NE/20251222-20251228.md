- **[arXiv251222] Optimisation of Aircraft Maintenance Schedules**
  - **tags:** [ai], [evolutionary algorithms], [evolutionary algorithm, genetic operators, fitness function, maintenance scheduling, optimisation]
  - **authors:** Neil Urquhart, Amir Rahimi, Efstathios-Al. Tingas
  - **institution:** Edinburgh Napier University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17412
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper applies an Evolutionary Algorithm to solve the aircraft maintenance scheduling problem, which involves assigning qualified staff to tasks within a turnaround window. The algorithm is benchmarked on 60 generated problem instances to evaluate its performance. The study demonstrates the proposed representation and genetic operators for this optimisation task.

- **[arXiv251222] Assessing Long-Term Electricity Market Design for Ambitious Decarbonization Targets using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [multi-agent reinforcement learning, independent proximal policy optimization, agent-based modeling, electricity markets, capacity markets, contracts for difference]
  - **authors:** Javier Gonzalez-Ruiz, Carlos Rodriguez-Pardo, Iacopo Savelli, Alice Di Bella, Massimo Tavoni
  - **institution:** Politecnico di Milano, CMCC Foundation - Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, RFF-CMCC European Institute on Economics and the Environment, Bocconi University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17444
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using independent proximal policy optimization, to model investment decisions by generation companies in long-term electricity markets. The model is applied to a stylized Italian electricity system to test various market designs and policy scenarios. The results demonstrate that market design is critical for achieving decarbonization targets while mitigating price volatility.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes a graph attention network (GAT) framework that models EEG signals as spatio-temporal graphs to detect epilepsy, with a focus on low-cost hardware for deployment in low-resource settings. The method adapts GATs to analyze edge connectivity for biomarker identification and is designed for lightweight training and deployment. The results demonstrate promising classification performance and highlight the potential for scalable, accessible diagnostic support in underserved regions.
