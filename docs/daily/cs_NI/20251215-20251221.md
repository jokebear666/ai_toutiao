  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [hyperparameter tuning, grid search, random search, recursive feature elimination, support vector machine, KDD CUP 1999 dataset, tenfold cross-validation]
  - **authors:** Sudhanshu Sekhar Tripathy, Bichitrananda Behera
  - **institution:** C.V. Raman Global University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15779
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper evaluates multiple machine learning algorithms for network intrusion detection, applying hyperparameter tuning via grid and random search along with Recursive Feature Elimination. The optimized Support Vector Machine classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 99.12% on the KDD CUP 1999 dataset, demonstrating that systematic tuning significantly enhances detection performance.

- **[arXiv251219] Coordinated Anti-Jamming Resilience in Swarm Networks via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [multi-agent reinforcement learning, QMIX, reactive jamming, channel hopping, power control, Upper Confidence Bound]

  - **institution:** Nexcepta
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16813
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework based on the QMIX algorithm to coordinate anti-jamming strategies in swarm networks. The method enables agents to jointly select transmission channels and power levels to counter an adaptive reactive jammer. The results show that QMIX achieves near-optimal performance, higher throughput, and lower jamming incidence compared to baseline policies, demonstrating its effectiveness for securing swarm communications.
