  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes AIMformer, a transformer-based framework for real-time misbehavior detection in vehicular platoons. It uses multi-head self-attention to capture spatiotemporal dependencies and a precision-focused loss to minimize false positives. The method demonstrates high performance and achieves sub-millisecond inference latency, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms.
