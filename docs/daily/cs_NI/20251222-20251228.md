- **[arXiv251222] Timely Information Updating for Mobile Devices Without and With ML Advice**
  - **tags:** [sys], [online scheduling], [competitive online algorithm, age of information, consistency-robustness trade-off, ML-augmented algorithm, adversarial environment]
  - **authors:** Yu-Pin Hsu, Yi-Hsuan Tseng
  - **institution:** National Taipei University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17381
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes an online algorithm for a mobile device to decide when to send status updates to an access point, balancing information timeliness and update cost. The algorithm achieves an optimal competitive ratio against adversarial uncertainties and, when augmented with machine learning advice, attains an optimal consistency-robustness trade-off. The main conclusion is that an optimal competitive algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to ML advice, either fully trusting or completely ignoring it.

- **[arXiv251222] STAR: Semantic-Traffic Alignment and Retrieval for Zero-Shot HTTPS Website Fingerprinting**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [multi-modal inference], [zero-shot learning, cross-modal retrieval, dual-encoder architecture, contrastive learning, structure-aware augmentation, semantic-traffic alignment]
  - **authors:** Yifei Cheng, Yujia Zhu, Baiyang Li, Xinhao Deng, Yitong Cai, Yaochen Ren, Qingyun Liu

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17667
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces STAR, a method that reformulates website fingerprinting as a zero-shot cross-modal retrieval problem, using a dual-encoder architecture to learn a joint embedding space for encrypted traffic traces and website logic profiles. It achieves high accuracy on unseen websites by aligning semantic and traffic features, demonstrating that semantic leakage is a major privacy risk in encrypted HTTPS traffic.
