- **[arXiv251222] Timely Information Updating for Mobile Devices Without and With ML Advice**
  - **tags:** [sys], [online scheduling], [competitive online algorithm, age of information, consistency-robustness trade-off, ML-augmented algorithm, adversarial environment]
  - **authors:** Yu-Pin Hsu, Yi-Hsuan Tseng
  - **institution:** National Taipei University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17381
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes an online algorithm for a mobile device to decide when to send status updates to an access point, balancing information timeliness and update cost. The algorithm achieves an optimal competitive ratio against adversarial uncertainties and, when augmented with machine learning advice, attains an optimal consistency-robustness trade-off. The main conclusion is that an optimal competitive algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to ML advice, either fully trusting or completely ignoring it.

- **[arXiv251222] STAR: Semantic-Traffic Alignment and Retrieval for Zero-Shot HTTPS Website Fingerprinting**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [multi-modal inference], [zero-shot learning, cross-modal retrieval, dual-encoder architecture, contrastive learning, structure-aware augmentation, semantic-traffic alignment]
  - **authors:** Yifei Cheng, Yujia Zhu, Baiyang Li, Xinhao Deng, Yitong Cai, Yaochen Ren, Qingyun Liu
  - **institution:** Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Tsinghua University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17667
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces STAR, a method that reformulates website fingerprinting as a zero-shot cross-modal retrieval problem, using a dual-encoder architecture to learn a joint embedding space for encrypted traffic traces and website logic profiles. It achieves high accuracy on unseen websites by aligning semantic and traffic features, demonstrating that semantic leakage is a major privacy risk in encrypted HTTPS traffic.

- **[arXiv251223] Asynchronous Pipeline Parallelism for Real-Time Multilingual Lip Synchronization in Video Communication Systems**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [multi-modal inference], [pipeline parallelism, asynchronous execution, message-queue decoupling, graph compilation, mixed-precision quantization, kernel fusion, silence-detection, transformer]
  - **authors:** Eren Caglar, Amirkia Rafiei Oskooei, Mehmet Kutanoglu, Mustafa Keles, Mehmet S. Aktas
  - **institution:** Yildiz Technical University, Aktif Investment Bank Inc.
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18318
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes an asynchronous pipeline-parallel Transformer framework for real-time multilingual lip synchronization, which decouples translation, speech, and lip-sync modules using message queues and optimizes them with graph compilation and quantization. The method reduces end-to-end latency by up to 3.1 times compared to sequential approaches while maintaining accuracy, making it suitable for resource-constrained AIoT communication systems.
