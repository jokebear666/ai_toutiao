  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents R²CCL, a fault-tolerant collective communication library designed to handle network faults in large-scale LLM training and serving. It achieves low-overhead recovery through techniques like rapid connection migration and bandwidth-aware load redistribution. Evaluation shows it incurs minimal performance overhead and significantly outperforms existing solutions.
