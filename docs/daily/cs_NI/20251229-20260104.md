  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22743
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes OptiNIC, a domain-specific RDMA transport that eliminates retransmissions and in-order delivery from the NIC, shifting to a best-effort, out-of-order model. 2. Introduces adaptive timeouts to trigger forward progress in case of data loss or delay, decoupling completion signaling from complete data delivery. 3.
