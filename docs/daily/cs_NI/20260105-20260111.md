  - **tags:** [sys], [delay-tolerant networking], [DTN, Epidemic Routing, PROPHET, disaster response, evacuation simulation]
  - **authors:** Keiya Kawano, Milena Radenkovic
  - **institution:** The University of Nottingham
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00109
  - **contributions:** 1. Evaluated the performance of Epidemic and PROPHET DTN routing protocols in a realistic, pre-tsunami evacuation scenario on Hachijojima island. 2. Used a simplified and pessimistic mobility model where evacuees (pedestrians, cars, emergency vehicles) are not explicitly guided to shelters, testing protocol resilience under uncoordinated movement. 3. Provided insights into which protocol offers better delivery delay and delivery ratio for getting critical information to safe shelter nodes within a limited time window before a tsunami arrives.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents CTMap, a framework that combines a millimeter-wave network digital twin with a large language model to plan navigation routes that optimize wireless connectivity instead of just distance. It uses simulation tools to create signal maps, a modified pathfinding algorithm to generate optimal routes, and an instruction-tuned LLM to interpret natural language queries. Experiments show the approach can improve cumulative signal strength by up to ten times compared to traditional shortest-path methods.

  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a novel scheduling framework for TWDM-EPON-based fronthaul that eliminates the need for a dedicated registration wavelength. 2. Enables periodic registration of Radio Units (RUs) without interrupting ongoing data transmissions, thereby meeting stringent eCPRI delay/jitter requirements. 3. Demonstrates a significant performance improvement, supporting up to 71% more RUs for a given number of wavelengths compared to the baseline dedicated-wavelength scheme.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the problem of inefficient bandwidth utilization in TWDM-EPON fronthaul caused by the traditional registration process halting data traffic. The authors propose a new scheduling framework that allows periodic registration to occur without dedicating a separate wavelength channel. The main result is that this method can support up to 71% more Radio Units compared to the baseline approach, significantly improving fronthaul capacity.
