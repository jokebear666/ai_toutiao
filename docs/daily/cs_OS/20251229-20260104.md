- **[arXiv251229] LEFT-RS: A Lock-Free Fault-Tolerant Resource Sharing Protocol for Multicore Real-Time Systems**
  - **tags:** [sys], [real-time systems], [lock-free, fault-tolerance, resource sharing, multicore, worst-case response time analysis]
  - **authors:** Nan Chen, Xiaotian Dai, Tong Cheng, Alan Burns, Iain Bate, Shuai Zhao
  - **institution:** University of York, Sun Yat-sen University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21701
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes the LEFT-RS protocol, a lock-free design that allows concurrent read access to global resources and parallel entry into critical sections, improving efficiency. 2. Enhances fault resilience by limiting overhead and enabling tasks to complete earlier if others experience faults, reducing blocking. 3. Provides a comprehensive worst-case response time analysis to ensure timing guarantees for the proposed protocol.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes LEFT-RS, a lock-free and fault-tolerant resource sharing protocol for multicore real-time systems. It allows tasks to concurrently access resources and enter critical sections in parallel, improving efficiency and resilience to transient faults. Evaluation shows it significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an 84.5% average improvement in schedulability.

- **[arXiv251230] A unified framework for detecting point and collective anomalies in operating system logs via collaborative transformers**
  - **tags:** [sec], [log anomaly detection], [collaborative transformers, multi-head impressed attention, modality adaptation layer]
  - **authors:** Mohammad Nasirzadeh, Jafar Tahmoresnezhad, Parviz Rashidi-Khazaee
  - **institution:** Urmia University of Technology
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23380
  - **code:** https://github.com/your-repo/CoLog (Note: The provided text states "We also provide the implementation of CoLog atthis https URL." but the specific URL is cut off in the input. Based on the placeholder, the typical format is used. If the exact URL is required, it would be the one following "atthis" in the original text.)
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes CoLog, a unified framework for detecting both point and collective anomalies in OS logs by applying multimodal sentiment analysis concepts. 2. Introduces collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions between different log data modalities. 3. Incorporates a modality adaptation layer to handle heterogeneity and adapt representations from different log modalities.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper addresses the challenge of log anomaly detection, where existing methods struggle with the multimodal nature of log data and the interactions between these modalities. It proposes CoLog, a framework that uses collaborative transformers and a modality adaptation layer to learn nuanced patterns across log modalities for comprehensive anomaly detection. Extensive experiments show CoLog achieves state-of-the-art performance, with mean precision, recall, and F1 scores over 99.5% across seven benchmark datasets.
