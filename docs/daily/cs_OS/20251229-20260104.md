- **[arXiv251229] LEFT-RS: A Lock-Free Fault-Tolerant Resource Sharing Protocol for Multicore Real-Time Systems**
  - **tags:** [sys], [real-time systems], [lock-free, fault-tolerance, resource sharing, multicore, worst-case response time analysis]
  - **authors:** Nan Chen, Xiaotian Dai, Tong Cheng, Alan Burns, Iain Bate, Shuai Zhao

  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes the LEFT-RS protocol, a lock-free design that allows concurrent read access to global resources and parallel entry into critical sections, improving efficiency. 2. Enhances fault resilience by limiting overhead and enabling tasks to complete earlier if others experience faults, reducing blocking. 3. Provides a comprehensive worst-case response time analysis to ensure timing guarantees for the proposed protocol.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes LEFT-RS, a lock-free and fault-tolerant resource sharing protocol for multicore real-time systems. It allows tasks to concurrently access resources and enter critical sections in parallel, improving efficiency and resilience to transient faults. Evaluation shows it significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an 84.5% average improvement in schedulability.
