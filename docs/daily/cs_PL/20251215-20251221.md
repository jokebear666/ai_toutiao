  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces a programming abstraction called "shared program state" to enable seamless interoperability between natural language code (prompts) and formal program code (e.g., Python). It implements this abstraction in the Nightjar system, allowing natural code to directly read and write program variables. The results show that Nightjar programs can achieve higher task accuracy (+4-19%) and reduce lines of code by 39.6% on average, though with a runtime overhead of 0.4-4.3x compared to manual implementations.
