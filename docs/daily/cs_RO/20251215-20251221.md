  - **tags:** [ai], [computer vision], [monocular depth estimation, 3D hallucination, Laplacian-based evaluation, grounded self-distillation, depth foundation models]
  - **authors:** Hoang Nguyen, Xiaohao Xu, Xiaonan Huang

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15423
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces a framework to address the "3D Mirage" problem in monocular depth estimation, where models hallucinate 3D structures from flat but ambiguous inputs like street art. The method includes a new benchmark (3D-Mirage), a Laplacian-based evaluation with metrics (DCS, CCS), and a parameter-efficient correction technique called Grounded Self-Distillation. The work concludes that depth model evaluation must shift from pixel accuracy to structural robustness to mitigate this safety-critical vulnerability.
