  - **tags:** [ai], [reinforcement learning], [reinforcement learning, model predictive control, MPPI, hierarchical planning, adaptive sampling]
  - **authors:** Toshiaki Hori, Jonathan DeCastro, Deepak Gopinath, Avinash Balachandran, Guy Rosman
  - **institution:** Toyota Research Institute
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17091
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a method that fuses reinforcement learning and model-predictive control (MPC) into an adaptive hierarchical framework. It uses RL actions to guide the MPPI sampler and adaptively aggregates MPPI samples to improve value estimation, leading to more robust and sample-efficient policies. The approach demonstrates improved data efficiency, performance, and convergence speed in domains like race driving and Lunar Lander.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17129
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces DiffeoMorph, a differentiable framework that uses an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network to train agents to collectively morph into target 3D shapes. It employs a novel shape-matching loss based on 3D Zernike polynomials and uses implicit differentiation to handle a bilevel optimization problem for rotation alignment. The method successfully generates complex shapes from simple ellipsoids using minimal spatial cues.

- **[arXiv251222] Conservative Bias in Multi-Teacher Learning: Why Agents Prefer Low-Reward Advisors**
  - **tags:** [ai], [reinforcement learning], [interactive reinforcement learning, multi-teacher learning, Q-learning, teacher selection, concept drift]
  - **authors:** Maher Mesto, Francisco Cruz
  - **institution:** University of New South Wales, Universidad Central de Chile
