  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21375
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a dynamic prediction model that transforms time-varying light and shadow disturbances (e.g., sun glint) into 3D virtual obstacles for path planning. 2. Introduces an improved IFDS algorithm combined with an MPC framework to generate smooth, safe, and dynamically feasible real-time trajectories for UAVs. 3.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the problem of UAV water quality monitoring being hindered by dynamic illumination disturbances like shadows and sun glint, which degrade spectral data. The proposed method actively plans safe flight paths by modeling disturbances as obstacles, using an improved IFDS and MPC for real-time trajectory optimization, and dynamically adjusting altitude to improve data quality. Simulation results show the method achieves a 98% obstacle avoidance success rate and increases effective observation data volume by approximately 27%.

Discovers and demonstrates that the ability to transfer skills from human videos to robot policies is an emergent property that appears with sufficient scale and diversity in robot pre-training data. 3.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates whether Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can learn to transfer skills from human videos to robots, a task that is typically challenging. The authors propose a simple co-training method and find that this human-to-robot transfer capability emerges as a property of scale when the model is pre-trained on a sufficiently large and diverse dataset of robot tasks. Their experiments show that with diverse pre-training, leveraging human data can nearly double performance on tasks seen only in human videos.

  - **institution:** Georgia Institute of Technology
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22757
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes an iterative active constraint learning (ACL) algorithm that intelligently queries for new demonstrations to reduce constraint uncertainty. 2. Integrates a Gaussian process (GP) model within the learning from demonstrations (LfD) paradigm to represent and infer unknown constraints. 3.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the data inefficiency of learning unknown constraints from demonstrations by proposing an active learning algorithm. The method iteratively trains a Gaussian process on demonstration data to model constraints and uses the model's uncertainty to query for new, informative start/goal states to generate more demonstrations. Experiments show the approach outperforms a random-sampling baseline in accurately inferring constraints from fewer demonstrations in high-dimensional, nonlinear environments.
