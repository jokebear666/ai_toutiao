  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21375
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes a dynamic prediction model that transforms time-varying light and shadow disturbances (e.g., sun glint) into 3D virtual obstacles for path planning. 2. Introduces an improved IFDS algorithm combined with an MPC framework to generate smooth, safe, and dynamically feasible real-time trajectories for UAVs. 3.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the problem of UAV water quality monitoring being hindered by dynamic illumination disturbances like shadows and sun glint, which degrade spectral data. The proposed method actively plans safe flight paths by modeling disturbances as obstacles, using an improved IFDS and MPC for real-time trajectory optimization, and dynamically adjusting altitude to improve data quality. Simulation results show the method achieves a 98% obstacle avoidance success rate and increases effective observation data volume by approximately 27%.

Discovers and demonstrates that the ability to transfer skills from human videos to robot policies is an emergent property that appears with sufficient scale and diversity in robot pre-training data. 3.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates whether Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can learn to transfer skills from human videos to robots, a task that is typically challenging. The authors propose a simple co-training method and find that this human-to-robot transfer capability emerges as a property of scale when the model is pre-trained on a sufficiently large and diverse dataset of robot tasks. Their experiments show that with diverse pre-training, leveraging human data can nearly double performance on tasks seen only in human videos.

  - **institution:** Georgia Institute of Technology
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22757
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes an iterative active constraint learning (ACL) algorithm that intelligently queries for new demonstrations to reduce constraint uncertainty. 2. Integrates a Gaussian process (GP) model within the learning from demonstrations (LfD) paradigm to represent and infer unknown constraints. 3.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the data inefficiency of learning unknown constraints from demonstrations by proposing an active learning algorithm. The method iteratively trains a Gaussian process on demonstration data to model constraints and uses the model's uncertainty to query for new, informative start/goal states to generate more demonstrations. Experiments show the approach outperforms a random-sampling baseline in accurately inferring constraints from fewer demonstrations in high-dimensional, nonlinear environments.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24426
  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces Counterfactual VLA (CF-VLA), a self-reflective framework that enables an autonomous driving model to reason about and revise its planned actions before execution through counterfactual reasoning. 2. Proposes a rollout-filter-label pipeline to efficiently mine high-value scenes and label counterfactual reasoning traces for training, enabling the acquisition of self-reflective capabilities. 3. Demonstrates significant improvements in trajectory accuracy (up to 17.6%) and safety metrics (20.5%) on large-scale driving datasets, with adaptive reasoning that activates primarily in challenging scenarios.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the limitation of current reasoning-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which lack self-reflection on action safety. It proposes Counterfactual VLA (CF-VLA), a framework that first generates meta-actions, then performs counterfactual reasoning to simulate outcomes and correct unsafe plans before final trajectory generation. Experiments show CF-VLA significantly improves trajectory accuracy and safety while adaptively engaging reasoning only in complex scenarios.

  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces DarkEQA, the first benchmark for evaluating Embodied Question Answering (EQA) under multi-level, physics-based low-light conditions. 2. Features a physically faithful degradation pipeline that models illumination drop and sensor noise in linear RAW space, followed by an ISP-inspired renderer. 3. Systematically evaluates and reveals the limitations of state-of-the-art VLMs and the effectiveness of Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models as pre-processors in this challenging scenario.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper identifies a gap in evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for embodied agents under low-light conditions and proposes DarkEQA, a new benchmark that simulates realistic dark environments. The benchmark uses a physics-based image degradation model to test VLM robustness and the utility of image enhancement techniques. The evaluation reveals significant performance drops in VLMs under low-light, highlighting a critical area for improvement in robust embodied AI.

  - **contributions:** 1. A modular teleoperation interface that decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules (e.g., hand-eye coordination, locomotion) for efficient, high-quality data collection. 2. The Choice Policy, a novel imitation learning architecture that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them, enabling fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. 3. Empirical validation on real-world tasks (dishwasher loading, whiteboard wiping) showing superior performance over diffusion policies and behavior cloning, and highlighting the critical role of hand-eye coordination.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper tackles the challenge of achieving robust whole-body coordination for humanoid robots in unstructured environments. It proposes a system combining a modular teleoperation interface for data collection with a novel "Choice Policy" for imitation learning, which scores multiple candidate actions. Experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that this approach outperforms baseline methods and that hand-eye coordination is crucial for success in long-horizon manipulation.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that independently controls camera viewpoint and motion sequence to re-render dynamic scenes from a monocular video. The method uses a novel time-embedding mechanism and a temporal-warping training strategy to achieve robust space-time disentanglement. Experiments show the model enables continuous exploration across space and time, outperforming prior work.
