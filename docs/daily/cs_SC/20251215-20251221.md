  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes an intent-driven rescheduling system for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) that combines Answer Set Programming (ASP) with Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to handle ambiguous human requests. It uses a three-valued logic and a decision tree to interpret vague user intents for transparent schedule adjustments. The main conclusion is that this integrated framework provides a robust, explainable, and adaptive structure for UAM scheduling.
