  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes exploiting structural sparsity (via the variable dependency graph's treewidth) to mitigate the high complexity of quantifier elimination., 2. Develops a novel dynamic programming framework structured over a tree decomposition for applying FME and CAD., 3. Proves that when treewidth is constant, the framework reduces the worst-case complexity from doubly exponential to single exponential for both FME and CAD.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the high complexity of quantifier elimination (QE) procedures like Fourier-Motzkin elimination (FME) and cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD). It proposes a new dynamic programming framework that leverages the low treewidth of the variable dependency graph to structure the elimination process. The key result is that for constant treewidth, the method achieves an exponential improvement, reducing worst-case complexity from doubly exponential to single exponential, which is validated by preliminary experiments on sparse benchmarks.
