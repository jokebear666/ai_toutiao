- **[arXiv251222] Do Foundational Audio Encoders Understand Music Structure?**
  - **tags:** [ai], [music information retrieval], [music structure analysis, foundational audio encoders, self-supervised learning, masked language modeling, boundary detection, function prediction]
  - **authors:** Keisuke Toyama, Zhi Zhong, Akira Takahashi, Shusuke Takahashi, Yuki Mitsufuji
  - **institution:** Sony Group Corporation, Sony AI
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17209
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates the use of pretrained foundational audio encoders (FAEs) for music structure analysis (MSA). Through comprehensive experiments on 11 FAE types, it finds that models using self-supervised learning with masked language modeling on music data are particularly effective for MSA tasks like boundary detection and function prediction.

- **[arXiv251222] LibriVAD: A Scalable Open Dataset with Deep Learning Benchmarks for Voice Activity Detection**
  - **tags:** [ai], [speech processing], [voice activity detection, vision transformer, MFCC, Gammatone filter bank cepstral coefficients, dataset augmentation, out-of-distribution evaluation]
  - **authors:** Ioannis Stylianou, Achintya kr. Sarkar, Nauman Dawalatabad, James Glass, Zheng-Hua Tan
  - **institution:** Aalborg University, Pioneer Centre for AI, IIIT SriCity, Zoom Communications Inc., Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17281
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces LibriVAD, a scalable open dataset for voice activity detection (VAD) created by augmenting LibriSpeech with diverse noise sources. It benchmarks several feature-model combinations and proposes using a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for VAD. The main conclusion is that ViT with MFCC features outperforms established models across various conditions, and scaling the dataset size and balancing its silence-to-speech ratio consistently improves out-of-distribution generalization.

- **[arXiv251222] Robust TTS Training via Self-Purifying Flow Matching for the WildSpoof 2026 TTS Track**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [diffusion training], [Self-Purifying Flow Matching (SPFM), flow matching, text-to-speech (TTS), Supertonic, fine-tuning, in-the-wild speech, label noise mitigation]
  - **authors:** June Young Yi, Hyeongju Kim, Juheon Lee
  - **institution:** Supertone Inc.
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17293
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents a lightweight TTS system that fine-tunes the Supertonic model using Self-Purifying Flow Matching (SPFM) to robustly adapt to noisy, in-the-wild speech data. SPFM handles label noise by comparing conditional and unconditional flow matching losses, routing suspicious samples for unconditional training while still using their acoustic information. The resulting model achieved the best word error rate in the WildSpoof 2026 challenge, demonstrating that open-weight architectures can be effectively adapted to real-world conditions with explicit noise-handling mechanisms.

- **[arXiv251222] When De-noising Hurts: A Systematic Study of Speech Enhancement Effects on Modern Medical ASR Systems**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [MetricGAN-plus-voicebank, semantic WER, noise robustness, speech enhancement]
  - **authors:** Sujal Chondhekar, Vasanth Murukuri, Rushabh Vasani, Sanika Goyal, Rajshree Badami, Anushree Rana, Sanjana SN, Karthik Pandia, Sulabh Katiyar, Neha Jagadeesh, Sankalp Gulati
  - **institution:** EkaCare (Orbi Health Private Limited)
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17562
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper systematically evaluates the effect of MetricGAN-plus-voicebank speech enhancement on four modern ASR systems using medical speech under nine noise conditions. The study finds that denoising preprocessing consistently degrades ASR performance across all models and conditions, suggesting modern ASR models are inherently noise-robust and enhancement may remove critical acoustic features.
