  - **institution:** Tsinghua University, Ant Group
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14754
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces a new metric, reliable@k, and an automated data augmentation pipeline to generate "cousin prompts" for evaluating nuance-oriented reliability in LLMs, constructing the IFEval++ benchmark. It finds that current LLMs show significant performance drops (up to 61.8%) with nuanced prompt variations, highlighting a crucial gap in real-world reliability.

- **[arXiv251218] CAPE: Capability Achievement via Policy Execution**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [post-training], [capability engineering, policy execution, specification language, verification, DPO, contextual objectivity, verification-fidelity scaling]
  - **authors:** David Ball
  - **institution:** Superficial Labs
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14761
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces CAPE, a protocol for Capability Engineering that implements a Specify-&gt;Verify-&gt;Correct-&gt;Train loop to convert requirements into executable specifications and train models to satisfy them by default. It demonstrates that CAPE reduces policy violation rates by 81% compared to DPO and significantly lowers costs and development timelines by using reusable specifications.

- **[arXiv251218] Workflows vs Agents for Code Translation**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [Model Context Protocol (MCP), syntax repair, code translation, MATLAB-to-HDL, agentic framework, conditional retrieval]
  - **authors:** Henry Gray, Tom Yotam, Octavian Udrea
  - **institution:** Code Metal
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14762
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper compares two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-hardware-description-language translation pipeline: a fixed expert-designed workflow and a more autonomous agentic approach using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The agentic approach, which dynamically selects tools, was more effective at resolving syntax errors, especially for small and mid-sized models, leading to significant downstream improvements in simulation success rates.

- **[arXiv251218] IaC Generation with LLMs: An Error Taxonomy and A Study on Configuration Knowledge Injection**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Graph RAG, knowledge injection, error taxonomy, Terraform, IaC-Eval benchmark]
  - **authors:** Roman Nekrasov, Stefano Fossati, Indika Kumara, Damian Andrew Tamburri, Willem-Jan van den Heuvel
  - **institution:** Jheronimus Academy of Data Science, Tilburg University, Eindhoven University of Technology, University of Sannio
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14792
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates improving Large Language Model (LLM) generation of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by injecting structured configuration knowledge using techniques from naive to Graph RAG. The study finds that while knowledge injection significantly boosts technical correctness, LLMs still struggle with nuanced user intent, revealing a "Correctness-Congruence Gap" where they are better coders than architects.

Through case studies with frameworks like OpenEvolve, it demonstrates that ADRS can produce solutions matching or surpassing human-designed state-of-the-art. The work outlines best practices for applying ADRS and discusses its potential to shift researcher effort toward problem formulation and strategic oversight.

It achieves an 80.19% reproduction rate on real-world bugs, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art, and a developer study confirms it improves success rates and reduces time and cognitive load for bug reproduction.

- **[arXiv251218] SeBERTis: A Framework for Producing Classifiers of Security-Related Issue Reports**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [masked language model, fine-tuning, semantic surrogates, deep neural network, BERT]
  - **authors:** Sogol Masoumzadeh, Yufei Li, Shane McIntosh, Dániel Varró, Lili Wei
  - **institution:** McGill University, University of Waterloo, Linköping University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15003
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes SEBERTIS, a framework that fine-tunes bidirectional transformer models (like BERT) as Masked Language Models using semantically equivalent vocabulary (Semantic Surrogates) to create classifiers for security-related issue reports. This method reduces reliance on lexical shortcuts, enabling better detection of complex issues. The resulting classifier significantly outperforms existing ML and LLM baselines in precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating high effectiveness for real-time issue triage.

  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [Meta-Prompting Protocol, Adversarial Trinity, DSPy, TextGrad, textual gradients, semantic computation graph]
  - **authors:** Fanzhe Fu
  - **institution:** Zhejiang University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15053
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces the Meta-Prompting Protocol, a framework that formalizes LLM orchestration as a programmable system using an adversarial topology (Generator, Auditor, Optimizer) to treat prompts as differentiable variables. It leverages textual critiques as gradients within a semantic computation graph to mitigate hallucination and improve reliability. The authors demonstrate its theoretical viability with tools like DSPy and TextGrad, proposing a foundation for deterministic "Observable Software Engineering" for probabilistic models.

- **[arXiv251218] On Assessing the Relevance of Code Reviews Authored by Generative Models**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [multi-subjective ranking, code review generation, ChatGPT, human evaluation, CodeReview StackExchange]
  - **authors:** Robert Heumüller, Frank Ortmeier
  - **institution:** Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15466
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a multi-subjective ranking method to evaluate AI-generated code review comments, comparing ChatGPT outputs against top human responses from CodeReview StackExchange. The results show that ChatGPT's comments were ranked significantly better than human-authored ones, even outperforming accepted answers. The method aims to provide a more meaningful assessment of generative AI in code review while highlighting risks of unchecked integration.

- **[arXiv251218] How Do Semantically Equivalent Code Transformations Impact Membership Inference on LLMs for Code?**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm training], [membership inference, semantically equivalent code transformation, variable renaming, causal analysis, code obfuscation]
  - **authors:** Hua Yang, Alejandro Velasco, Thanh Le-Cong, Md Nazmul Haque, Bowen Xu, Denys Poshyvanyk
  - **institution:** North Carolina State University, William & Mary, The University of Melbourne
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15468
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates how semantically equivalent code transformations, such as variable renaming, can be used to evade membership inference detection in large language models for code. It finds that these transformations, especially RenameVariable, can significantly reduce the success of membership inference attacks without substantially harming model performance. The results reveal a critical vulnerability in license compliance enforcement for code LLMs, showing that transformation-based obfuscation can weaken detection of unauthorized code usage.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15699
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces FrontierCS, a benchmark of 156 open-ended computer science problems where the optimal solution is unknown but can be objectively evaluated, requiring models to generate executable programs. It finds that current frontier reasoning models significantly lag behind human experts, and that merely increasing reasoning budgets or generating workable code does not close this performance gap.
