  - **tags:** [ai], [social network analysis], [resistance distance, greedy algorithm, combinatorial optimization, NP-hard, linear-time algorithm]
  - **authors:** Changan Liu, Xiaotian Zhou, Ahad N. Zehmakan, Zhongzhi Zhang
  - **institution:** Fudan University, Australian National University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14711
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes a method to enhance fairness in information access within social networks by adding new connections, formulated as an optimization problem using resistance distance. The main technical contribution is a linear-time algorithm that reduces the complexity of a greedy approach, enabling accurate solutions for large networks with millions of nodes.

- **[arXiv251218] The Graph-Embedded Hazard Model (GEHM): Stochastic Network Survival Dynamics on Economic Graphs**
  - **tags:** [ai], [network economics], [graph p-Laplacian, accretive operator theory, nonlinear semigroup methods, stochastic analysis, PDE-SDE systems]
  - **authors:** Diego Vallarino
  - **institution:** Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14705
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a Graph-Embedded Hazard Model (GEHM), a nonlinear PDE-SDE framework that couples graph-based p-Laplacian diffusion with stochastic drift to model survival dynamics on economic networks. The main conclusion is that hub dominance in networks like Barabási–Albert magnifies nonlinear gradients, compresses stability margins, and leads to heavy-tailed survival distributions with occasional explosive behavior.

- **[arXiv251218] Tourists Profiling by Interest Analysis**
  - **tags:** [ai], [data mining], [graph models, community detection, geo-located data, social network analysis, digital traces]
  - **authors:** Sonia Djebali, Quentin Gabot, Guillaume Guerard
  - **institution:** Léonard De Vinci, Research Center
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14704
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a method that uses both qualitative and quantitative analysis of digital traces from social networks to profile tourists. It employs graph models and community detection techniques to analyze geo-located data and understand tourist behavior dynamics within attraction networks. The main conclusion is that this combined approach provides a deeper understanding of tourist interests and movement patterns compared to purely quantitative studies.

- **[arXiv251218] SoMe: A Realistic Benchmark for LLM-based Social Media Agents**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [SoMe benchmark, social media agents, LLM-based agents, agent tools, task evaluation, quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis]
  - **authors:** Dizhan Xue, Jing Cui, Shengsheng Qian, Chuanrui Hu, Changsheng Xu
  - **institution:** Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Tianjin University of Technology; Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications; Peng Cheng Laboratory
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14720
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces SoMe, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM-based social media agents across diverse tasks using real social media data and agent tools. The evaluation shows that current LLMs, both closed and open-source, perform unsatisfactorily on these realistic social media agent tasks. SoMe serves as a challenging testbed to advance future social media agent development.

- **[arXiv251218] Compute the edge p-Laplacian centrality for air traffic network**
  - **tags:** [ai], [graph theory, network analysis], [p-Laplacian centrality, line graph, un-normalized graph Laplacian, node centrality, edge centrality]
  - **authors:** Loc Hoang Tran, Bao Nguyen Tran, Luong Anh Tuan Nguyen
  - **institution:** Vietnam Aviation Academy
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14749
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a method to compute edge p-Laplacian centrality for an air traffic network by first converting the network into a line graph and then computing the node p-Laplacian centrality on that line graph. The method is based on a novel un-normalized graph p-Laplacian operator. The experimental results show that this ranking method can be successfully implemented.

- **[arXiv251218] Cyberswarm: a novel swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by cyber community dynamics**
  - **tags:** [ai], [recommendation systems], [swarm intelligence, dynamic hypergraph, centrality-based feature extraction, Node2Vec embeddings, message-passing mechanisms, hierarchical graph modeling]
  - **authors:** Abdelsadeq Elfergany, Ammar Adl, Mohammed Kayed
  - **institution:** Not specified in provided text
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14752
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces Cyberswarm, a general-purpose swarm intelligence algorithm for recommendation systems that models user preferences and community influences using a dynamic hypergraph structure with techniques like Node2Vec and message-passing. Experimental results show it outperforms baseline methods on metrics like HR, MRR, and NDCG across various tasks. The work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating swarm intelligence with network dynamics for adaptive and precise recommendations.

- **[arXiv251218] Model inference for ranking from pairwise comparisons**
  - **tags:** [ai], [ranking algorithms], [Bayesian inference, pairwise comparisons, latent strength, model inference, Chebyshev approximation, neural networks]
  - **authors:** Daniel Sánchez Catalina, George T. Cantwell
  - **institution:** University of Cambridge
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15269
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents an efficient Bayesian algorithm to jointly infer both the latent strengths of objects and the unknown function mapping strengths to win probabilities from pairwise comparison data. The method uses Chebyshev-based and neural network approaches to model this function without prior assumptions. Experimental results show robustness across model specifications and improved predictive accuracy, such as overcoming bookmaker profit margins in tennis data.
