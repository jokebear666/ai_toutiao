- **[arXiv251222] Bots Don't Sit Still: A Longitudinal Study of Bot Behaviour Change, Temporal Drift, and Feature-Structure Evolution**
  - **tags:** [ai], [social media analysis], [Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, KPSS test, Spearman correlation, Chi-square test, time series analysis, stationarity testing]
  - **authors:** Ohoud Alzahrani, Russell Beale, Bob Hendley
  - **institution:** University of Birmingham
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17067
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper conducts a longitudinal study analyzing the temporal behavior of promotional Twitter bots using time series analysis and statistical tests on ten content-based meta-features. It finds that bot behavior is non-stationary, with individual features and their interdependencies evolving systematically over time and across bot generations. The conclusion is that bot-detection systems must account for this dynamic adaptation and avoid treating behavioral features as static.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17239
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a method to generate a privacy-preserving synthetic dataset of individual daily trajectories by integrating aggregated origin-destination flows with behavioral constraints in a multi-objective optimization framework. The method successfully reproduces realistic human mobility patterns in two Japanese regions, providing a practical pathway for high-resolution mobility analytics without using sensitive personal data.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20679
  - **contributions:** 1. Empirically tests the relationship between information source (social media vs. mainstream news) and perceived verification difficulty (epistemic self-efficacy) during a high-volatility election. 2. Identifies perceived exposure to inaccurate information as a mediator and information fatigue as a key moderator in the verification process. 3. Challenges platform-deterministic theories by finding that demographics and universal information fatigue, not platform type, are primary drivers of epistemic burden in volatile environments.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This study analyzes how voters perceive their ability to verify news (epistemic self-efficacy) during the volatile 2024 U.S. election, using survey data to test hypotheses about information sources, misinformation exposure, and fatigue. Contrary to expectations, it finds no significant difference in verification difficulty between social media and mainstream news users, concluding that cognitive factors like universal information fatigue are more critical than platform choice.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21138
  - **contributions:** 1. Conducted a systematic structural and dynamic comparison between emotion diffusion in real-world social graphs (from Reddit) and LLM-simulated interaction networks. 2. Identified key structural discrepancies: real graphs show dense connectivity and sentiment shifts, while simulated graphs are largely isolated linear chains with monotonic emotions. 3. Demonstrated that these structural limitations in LLM-simulated graphs negatively impact downstream tasks like graph-based emotion prediction, reducing emotional diversity.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper compares emotion diffusion patterns in real social media graphs and those generated by LLM-based simulations. The method involves constructing and analyzing diffusion graphs from Reddit data and LLM-simulated conversations using sentiment analysis. The main conclusion is that current LLM-based social simulations fail to capture the interactive complexity and emotional heterogeneity of real networks, leading to structurally simplistic and less useful synthetic graphs.
