- **[arXiv251222] Bots Don't Sit Still: A Longitudinal Study of Bot Behaviour Change, Temporal Drift, and Feature-Structure Evolution**
  - **tags:** [ai], [social media analysis], [Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, KPSS test, Spearman correlation, Chi-square test, time series analysis, stationarity testing]
  - **authors:** Ohoud Alzahrani, Russell Beale, Bob Hendley
  - **institution:** University of Birmingham
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17067
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper conducts a longitudinal study analyzing the temporal behavior of promotional Twitter bots using time series analysis and statistical tests on ten content-based meta-features. It finds that bot behavior is non-stationary, with individual features and their interdependencies evolving systematically over time and across bot generations. The conclusion is that bot-detection systems must account for this dynamic adaptation and avoid treating behavioral features as static.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a method to generate a privacy-preserving synthetic dataset of individual daily trajectories by integrating aggregated origin-destination flows with behavioral constraints in a multi-objective optimization framework. The method successfully reproduces realistic human mobility patterns in two Japanese regions, providing a practical pathway for high-resolution mobility analytics without using sensitive personal data.
