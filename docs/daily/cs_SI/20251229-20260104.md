  - **contributions:** 1. Proposed a novel centrality metric (Harmonic Closeness with Temporal and Collaboration Count Decay - HCTCD) that incorporates temporal decay and collaboration intensity. 2. Advanced the methodological field by employing beta regression to model citation percentiles, appropriately handling the bounded nature of citation data. 3. Demonstrated that team-level centrality aggregation, particularly through exponentially weighted summation, explains citation variance more effectively than individual or rank-based approaches, highlighting the importance of collective network connectivity.

- **[arXiv251229] Heterogeneous fragmentation of empty sites promotes cooperation in phenotypically diverse populations with tag-mediated interactions**
  - **tags:** [ai], [evolutionary game theory], [agent-based model, tag-based cooperation, habitat fragmentation, Snowdrift game, Monte Carlo simulation]
  - **authors:** Hui Zhang, Tarik Hadzibeganovic, Xiao-Pu Han
  - **institution:** Northwestern Polytechnical University, University of Graz, Hangzhou Normal University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22077
  - **contributions:** 1. Developed a spatially explicit agent-based model to study the interplay between habitat fragmentation, phenotypic diversity, and the evolution of cooperation. 2. Demonstrated that heterogeneous fragmentation of empty sites, combined with high phenotypic diversity and low cost-to-benefit ratios, suppresses ethnocentric cooperation while promoting unconditional altruism. 3. Showcased the "anti-fragility" of cooperators, revealing they can benefit from harsh environmental conditions in fragmented, phenotypically diverse populations.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates how habitat fragmentation and phenotypic diversity influence the evolution of cooperation using a spatially explicit agent-based model based on the Snowdrift game. The simulations show that a combination of high phenotypic diversity, low interaction costs, and moderate fragmentation of empty sites strongly promotes unconditional cooperation while suppressing conditional, ethnocentric strategies. The main conclusion is that heterogeneous habitat fragmentation can act as a potent cooperation-promoting mechanism, demonstrating the resilience of cooperators in degraded environments.
