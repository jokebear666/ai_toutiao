  - **authors:** Hui Zhang, Tarik Hadzibeganovic, Xiao-Pu Han

Demonstrated that heterogeneous fragmentation of empty sites, combined with high phenotypic diversity and low cost-to-benefit ratios, suppresses ethnocentric cooperation while promoting unconditional altruism. 3. Showcased the "anti-fragility" of cooperators, revealing they can benefit from harsh environmental conditions in fragmented, phenotypically diverse populations.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates how habitat fragmentation and phenotypic diversity influence the evolution of cooperation using a spatially explicit agent-based model based on the Snowdrift game. The simulations show that a combination of high phenotypic diversity, low interaction costs, and moderate fragmentation of empty sites strongly promotes unconditional cooperation while suppressing conditional, ethnocentric strategies. The main conclusion is that heterogeneous habitat fragmentation can act as a potent cooperation-promoting mechanism, demonstrating the resilience of cooperators in degraded environments.

  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces heterogeneous R&D productivities into an endogenous R&D network formation model, generalizing a classic framework. 2. Shows that large productivity gaps destabilize the complete network and make positive assortative (PA) networks stable, overturning benchmark results. 3. Demonstrates a counterintuitive welfare result where higher average productivity can lead to lower welfare due to network structure changes and crowding-out effects.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper extends an R&D network formation model by incorporating heterogeneous firm productivities. It finds that large productivity differences lead to the instability of fully connected networks and the stability of networks where firms cluster by productivity (Positive Assortative networks). The key conclusion is that higher average R&D productivity can paradoxically reduce overall welfare by inducing less efficient network structures or crowding out effects.
