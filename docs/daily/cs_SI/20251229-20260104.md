  - **authors:** Hui Zhang, Tarik Hadzibeganovic, Xiao-Pu Han

Demonstrated that heterogeneous fragmentation of empty sites, combined with high phenotypic diversity and low cost-to-benefit ratios, suppresses ethnocentric cooperation while promoting unconditional altruism. 3. Showcased the "anti-fragility" of cooperators, revealing they can benefit from harsh environmental conditions in fragmented, phenotypically diverse populations.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates how habitat fragmentation and phenotypic diversity influence the evolution of cooperation using a spatially explicit agent-based model based on the Snowdrift game. The simulations show that a combination of high phenotypic diversity, low interaction costs, and moderate fragmentation of empty sites strongly promotes unconditional cooperation while suppressing conditional, ethnocentric strategies. The main conclusion is that heterogeneous habitat fragmentation can act as a potent cooperation-promoting mechanism, demonstrating the resilience of cooperators in degraded environments.

  - **contributions:** 1. Introduces heterogeneous R&D productivities into an endogenous R&D network formation model, generalizing a classic framework. 2. Shows that large productivity gaps destabilize the complete network and make positive assortative (PA) networks stable, overturning benchmark results. 3. Demonstrates a counterintuitive welfare result where higher average productivity can lead to lower welfare due to network structure changes and crowding-out effects.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper extends an R&D network formation model by incorporating heterogeneous firm productivities. It finds that large productivity differences lead to the instability of fully connected networks and the stability of networks where firms cluster by productivity (Positive Assortative networks). The key conclusion is that higher average R&D productivity can paradoxically reduce overall welfare by inducing less efficient network structures or crowding out effects.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper analyzes the relationship between academic collaboration and prizewinning in Computer Science by studying over 100 prizes and 5,000 winners. Using methods like Coarsened Exact Matching and regression, it finds that prizewinners collaborate more with each other, and such collaborations increase the odds of winning future awards. The study also contextualizes these findings by comparing Nobel and Turing award trajectories.

  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes Community-IM++, a scalable framework that explicitly models cross-community influence, overcoming a key limitation of prior community-based methods. 2. Introduces a principled heuristic based on community-based diffusion degree (CDD) and a progressive budgeting strategy to prioritize bridging nodes and allocate seeds adaptively. 3. Demonstrates through experiments on large real-world networks that the method achieves near-greedy influence spread with up to 100x speedup, outperforming baseline heuristics.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper addresses the Influence Maximization problem in social networks, where existing community-based methods often overlook inter-community influence. The authors propose Community-IM++, a scalable framework that explicitly models cross-community diffusion using a new heuristic (CDD) and a progressive budgeting strategy. The method achieves near-optimal performance with significantly lower runtime, making it practical for large-scale applications like viral marketing and public health campaigns.

  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes AttDeCoDe, a novel density-based community detection framework that integrates node attributes by estimating density in the attribute space. 2. Introduces a novel generative model for simulation that extends the degree-corrected stochastic block model with attribute-driven leader attraction. 3. Demonstrates the method's competitive performance and interpretability through simulation and an empirical application to Horizon programme collaboration data.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes AttDeCoDe, a method for detecting communities in networks where nodes have attributes.

The method is shown to be effective and interpretable through simulations and an application to research collaboration networks.

  - **contributions:** 1. A comprehensive evaluation of the silhouette score's performance in network-based community detection across various network types (unweighted, weighted, fully connected). 2. Identification of specific conditions (network size, separation strength, community size imbalance) under which the silhouette score accurately identifies, underestimates, or overestimates the true number of communities. 3. Demonstration of the silhouette score's practical utility by applying it to a real-world airline reachability network to recover geographically and market-interpretable clusters.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper comprehensively evaluates the silhouette score for selecting the number of communities in network clustering. Through simulations and a real-world case study, it finds the score works well for balanced, well-separated clusters but can fail under imbalance, weak separation, or sparsity, providing empirical guidance for its reliable application.
