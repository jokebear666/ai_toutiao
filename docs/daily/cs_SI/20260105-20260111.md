- **[arXiv260105] Impact of Clustering on the Observability and Controllability of Complex Networks**
  - **tags:** [other], [network controllability], [clustering, scale-free networks, observability, controllability, structured systems theory]
  - **authors:** Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Hamid R. Rabiee
  - **institution:** Semnan University, Sharif University of Technology
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00221
  - **contributions:** 1. Investigates and quantifies the relationship between network clustering and the requirements for observability and controllability in scale-free networks., 2. Demonstrates through simulations that densely clustered networks require fewer driver and observer nodes, offering a structural optimization principle., 3. Provides practical insights for reducing sensor/actuator placement in resource-constrained applications like social networks and intelligent transportation systems.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper studies how clustering affects the observability and controllability of complex scale-free networks. Using structured systems theory and Monte-Carlo simulations, it shows that higher clustering reduces the number of required driver and observer nodes. The findings suggest that network design can be optimized for control and monitoring by increasing clustering, especially in resource-limited scenarios.

- **[arXiv260105] Effects of Limited Field of View on Musical Collaboration Experience with Avatars in Extended Reality**
  - **tags:** [other], [human-computer interaction], [extended reality, field of view, musical collaboration, co-presence, gesture recognition]
  - **authors:** Suibi Che-Chuan Weng, Torin Hopkins, Shih-Yu Ma, Amy Banic, Ellen Yi-Luen Do
  - **institution:** University of Colorado Boulder, University of Wyoming, SolJAMM Research
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00333
  - **contributions:** 1. Conducted a comparative study investigating the specific impact of a limited field of view (FOV) on key aspects of musical collaboration in XR, such as co-presence and reaction time. 2. Proposed and evaluated a novel notification system ("Mini Musicians") designed to mitigate the negative effects of a limited FOV in AR-based musical collaboration. 3. Provided empirical evidence that while limited FOV degrades the collaborative experience, interface interventions like notifications can improve performance metrics like reaction time.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper studies how the limited field of view (FOV) in XR head-mounted displays affects musical collaboration. It compares an unrestricted holographic setup (HoloJam) with a limited-FOV AR setup and tests a notification system (Mini Musicians) to improve awareness. The results show that limited FOV reduces co-presence and enjoyment, but notification systems can help improve reaction times.

  - **tags:** [nlp], [fake news detection], [BERTopic, Gini index, FakeBERT, information overload, topic modeling]
  - **authors:** Jan Rawa, Julian Sienkiewicz
  - **institution:** Warsaw University of Technology
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00496
  - **contributions:** 1. Proposes using the Gini index from BERTopic topic distributions as a proxy for information overload (IOL) in large datasets. 2. Demonstrates a significant global correlation between this IOL proxy and the fraction of fake news detected by FakeBERT on COVID-19 related Reddit data. 3. Reveals ambiguous correlation results at the individual community level, highlighting the complexity of the IOL-fake news relationship.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This study investigates the correlation between information overload and fake news proliferation during the COVID-19 pandemic. It proposes using the Gini index derived from BERTopic topic distributions as an automatic proxy for information overload and tests it on Reddit data, finding a significant global correlation with fake news detected by FakeBERT, though community-level results are mixed.

- **[arXiv260105] Modeling Epidemic Dynamics of Mutant Strains with Evolutionary Game-based Vaccination Behavior**
  - **tags:** [other], [computational epidemiology], [SIRS model, evolutionary game theory, microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA)]
  - **authors:** Wenjie Zhang, Yusheng Li, Qin Li, Guojun Huang, Minyu Feng
  - **institution:** Southwest University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00757
  - **contributions:** 1. Developed an extended SIRS model that incorporates both mutant strain dynamics and an explicit vaccinated compartment. 2. Integrated evolutionary game theory to model individual vaccination decisions as a dynamic process influenced by social neighbors and epidemic status. 3. Coupled the epidemic spreading and behavioral processes using the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA) to analyze their co-evolution.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes a new epidemic modeling framework that combines an extended SIRS model for mutant strains with evolutionary game theory for vaccination behavior, linking them via a microscopic Markov chain approach. The results indicate this behavior-aware model can effectively mitigate outbreaks, with sensitivity analysis showing vaccine cost, efficacy, and perceived risk are key drivers of vaccination uptake. This framework provides theoretical support for designing public health policies.
