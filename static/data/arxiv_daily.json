Proposed an exploration-first adoption framework for integrating GenAI, emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling, while pairing recurrent risks with operational mitigations.",

The method exploits the agent's semantic imitation heuristic through a poisoned RAG store, leading to persistent behavioral compromise. The authors demonstrate that this attack can cause significant and stealthy behavioral drift in agents like MetaGPT's DataInterpreter.",

The proposed method first introduces a VAE-GAN hybrid video generator (EncGAN3) and then extends it using a Markov chain framework to sequentially generate short video clips, enabling the creation of temporally consistent long videos. The main conclusion is that this approach overcomes the temporal scaling limitation and allows for memory-efficient generation of long video sequences.",

          "summary": "This paper investigates the assumption that colorimetric calibration ensures reliable clinical biomarker extraction in smartphone dermatology. Using a large dataset and standard calibration, it finds that while color error is reduced, biomarker reliability remains poor, a phenomenon termed \"color-clinical decoupling,\" primarily due to anatomical variance and formula sensitivity. The conclusion is that current calibration standards are insufficient for clinical use and require region-aware protocols.",

Highlights the central paradox of GenAI workarounds: they enable functionality but can create unofficial \"shadow\" systems and obscure the crucial, politically charged labour involved.",

It argues such workarounds are essential acts of sociotechnical integration that reveal the \"invisible labour\" needed to make AI functional, but this labour is often obscured, creating a paradox.

          "contributions": "1. Proposes a novel architecture (zkFL-Health) that integrates Federated Learning with Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Trusted Execution Environments to ensure privacy and verifiable correctness in medical AI training. 2. Introduces a protocol where the aggregator, operating within a TEE, generates a succinct ZK proof to attest it used the correct inputs and aggregation rule, without revealing client updates. 3. Leverages a blockchain to provide an immutable audit trail of cryptographic commitments and proof verification, removing the need to trust a single party and enhancing regulatory compliance.",
          "summary": "The paper addresses privacy leakage and trust issues in federated learning for healthcare by proposing zkFL-Health, a framework that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs and TEEs to enable verifiable and private model aggregation. The method ensures the aggregator's computations are provably correct and recorded on a blockchain for auditability. The conclusion is that this approach provides strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, which are crucial for clinical adoption.",

Proposes a paradigm shift by representing agent policies as human-interpretable source code, bridging the gap between opaque neural policies and the need for strategy comprehension in multi-agent settings. 2. Introduces Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR), a novel algorithm that uses LLMs as point-wise best-response operators to synthesize and refine policy code based on game utility and unit tests. 3. Operationalizes the game-theoretic concept of Program Equilibrium for modern learning, demonstrating its effectiveness on coordination games and a cooperative foraging environment.",
          "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of dynamic strategy adaptation in multi-agent tasks by representing policies as interpretable source code and using Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize them. The core method, Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR), leverages LLMs to iteratively refine an agent's policy code in response to an opponent's strategy using textual feedback. The approach successfully solves standard coordination games and a cooperative environment, demonstrating a practical bridge between theoretical Program Equilibrium and modern AI learning.",

It demonstrates that this approach offers advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences compared to RLHF and NLHF. Experiments on large language models show that SLHF achieves strong alignment and enables inference-time refinements that transfer across model families.",

This XAI-guided DP approach reduces the success rates of membership inference and re-identification attacks while preserving model accuracy and improving inference time compared to traditional DP.

          "summary": "The paper proposes modeling information using confusion hypergraphs, which allows information to form a Heyting algebra and be manipulated with logical operations. This connection enables the requirements of communication networks (like network coding) to be expressed as logical formulae, from which optimal coding schemes can be directly computed, with the communication cost linked to hypergraph entropy. This establishes a novel correspondence between coding problems and logic, analogous to the Curry-Howard correspondence.",

The algorithm achieves an optimal competitive ratio against adversarial uncertainties and, when augmented with machine learning advice, attains an optimal consistency-robustness trade-off. The main conclusion is that an optimal competitive algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to ML advice, either fully trusting or completely ignoring it.",

Demonstrates superior performance over static scene graph methods in simulated environments with changed object positions and shows practical applicability in real-world experiments.",

It proposes LookPlanGraph, a method that continuously augments a memory graph with real-time visual observations from a VLM to verify and discover objects during plan execution. Experiments show it outperforms static graph methods in simulated and real-world settings, and a new dataset (GraSIF) is introduced for evaluation.",

It uses a three-valued logic and a decision tree to interpret vague user intents for transparent schedule adjustments. The main conclusion is that this integrated framework provides a robust, explainable, and adaptive structure for UAM scheduling.",
