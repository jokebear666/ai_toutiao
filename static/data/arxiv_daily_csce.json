It demonstrates superior generalization, long-horizon stability, and better preservation of physical properties compared to monolithic neural simulators.",

      "summary": "The paper proposes HD-Prot, a hybrid diffusion protein language model that integrates continuous structural tokens with discrete sequence tokens for joint modeling. It uses a unified absorbing diffusion process to handle both modalities, performing categorical prediction for sequences and continuous diffusion for structures. The model achieves competitive performance in tasks like co-generation and structure prediction, demonstrating the viability of combining categorical and continuous distributions in a unified architecture.",
