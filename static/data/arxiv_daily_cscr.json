      "summary": "This paper systematically evaluates how post-training quantization (PTQ) affects privacy by using membership inference attacks on models quantized with algorithms like AdaRound, BRECQ, and OBC. The study finds that lower-precision PTQ (e.g., 4-bit, 2-bit, 1.58-bit) significantly reduces privacy leakage, offering up to an order of magnitude less vulnerability compared to full-precision models, though at the cost of decreased utility. The results provide practical insights for balancing efficiency, accuracy, and privacy in model deployment.",

It is designed to be detectable from noisy external observations like video footage without degrading policy performance. The work demonstrates robust detection across various remote modalities, providing a non-invasive way to verify the provenance of physical robot policies.",

      "summary": "This paper investigates how semantically equivalent code transformations, such as variable renaming, can be used to evade membership inference detection in large language models for code. It finds that these transformations, especially RenameVariable, can significantly reduce the success of membership inference attacks without substantially harming model performance. The results reveal a critical vulnerability in license compliance enforcement for code LLMs, showing that transformation-based obfuscation can weaken detection of unauthorized code usage.",
