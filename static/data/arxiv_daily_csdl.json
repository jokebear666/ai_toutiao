      "contributions": "1. Proposed a novel centrality metric (Harmonic Closeness with Temporal and Collaboration Count Decay - HCTCD) that incorporates temporal decay and collaboration intensity. 2. Advanced the methodological field by employing beta regression to model citation percentiles, appropriately handling the bounded nature of citation data. 3. Demonstrated that team-level centrality aggregation, particularly through exponentially weighted summation, explains citation variance more effectively than individual or rank-based approaches, highlighting the importance of collective network connectivity.",
      "summary": "This study investigates how authors' positions in scientific collaboration networks influence citation disparities in top AI conferences. It proposes a new centrality metric (HCTCD) and uses beta regression to analyze data from NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR. The findings show that long-term network centrality, especially at the team level, is a strong predictor of citations, challenging evaluation paradigms that focus solely on content.",
