They prove tight upper and lower bounds on this number for different graph classes, establishing the optimality of their approach.",

It answers open questions by proving this equivalence (delineation) holds for intersection graphs of axis-parallel unit segments and circular arcs, but fails for visibility graphs of 1.5D terrains. The work leverages the theory of twin-width for ordered graphs, exploiting natural vertex orderings in geometric representations.",
