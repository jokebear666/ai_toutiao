Demonstrates that the V2 dynamical Ising machine can exactly solve discrete tomography problems, achieving high success probability (P_succ ≈ 1) from random initialization. 2. Shows that for problems where at most two rays intersect per pixel, the V2 model's convergence time depends only weakly on image size. 3. Identifies that the solving capability stems from the V2 model's intrinsic dynamical features, specifically its equations of motion enabling non-local spin transitions beyond Hamming-neighborhood constraints.",
      "summary": "This paper proposes using the V2 dynamical Ising machine to exactly reconstruct binary images from discrete tomographic data. The method converges with high probability to a solution that precisely satisfies the tomographic constraints, and its convergence time scales weakly with problem size for certain problem structures. The authors conclude that the V2 model's inherent dynamics, particularly its ability to make non-local transitions, enable it to solve this specific data processing task exactly, unlike typical optimization-focused Ising machine applications.",
