      "contributions": "1. Proposes a paradigm shift by representing agent policies as human-interpretable source code, bridging the gap between opaque neural policies and the need for strategy comprehension in multi-agent settings. 2. Introduces Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR), a novel algorithm that uses LLMs as point-wise best-response operators to synthesize and refine policy code based on game utility and unit tests. 3. Operationalizes the game-theoretic concept of Program Equilibrium for modern learning, demonstrating its effectiveness on coordination games and a cooperative foraging environment.",
      "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of dynamic strategy adaptation in multi-agent tasks by representing policies as interpretable source code and using Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize them. The core method, Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR), leverages LLMs to iteratively refine an agent's policy code in response to an opponent's strategy using textual feedback. The approach successfully solves standard coordination games and a cooperative environment, demonstrating a practical bridge between theoretical Program Equilibrium and modern AI learning.",
