      "summary": "This paper proposes a method that uses a Solomonoff-inspired scoring to weight hypotheses generated by a Large Language Model based on their simplicity and predictive fit. The method, applied to Mini-ARC tasks, produces uncertainty-aware predictions by spreading probability across multiple hypotheses, contrasting with Bayesian Model Averaging which tends to concentrate weight on a single candidate. The results highlight the value of algorithmic information-theoretic priors for robust, interpretable reasoning under uncertainty.",

The algorithm achieves an optimal competitive ratio against adversarial uncertainties and, when augmented with machine learning advice, attains an optimal consistency-robustness trade-off. The main conclusion is that an optimal competitive algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to ML advice, either fully trusting or completely ignoring it.",
