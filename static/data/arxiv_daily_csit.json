Introduces a new entropy-normalized complexity measure for binary words, defined as the ratio of Kolmogorov complexity to empirical entropy, to separate intrinsic descriptive complexity from symbol imbalance. 2. Proves that for Martin-Löf random sequences under constructive exchangeable measures, the adjusted complexity grows linearly and converges to one. 3. Demonstrates through a pathological construction that the regularity of the underlying measure is essential for this convergence result.",
      "summary": "This paper introduces a new measure of complexity for binary words by normalizing Kolmogorov complexity with the word's empirical entropy, aiming to isolate intrinsic algorithmic structure from the combinatorial effect of imbalanced symbol frequencies. The authors prove that for random sequences under certain measures, this adjusted complexity converges to one, and show that the regularity of the measure is crucial. The framework connects Kolmogorov complexity, entropy, and randomness, with potential applications in randomness testing and structured data analysis.",
