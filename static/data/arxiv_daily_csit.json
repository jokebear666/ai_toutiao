It demonstrates that prioritizing more informative data through information-theoretic metrics improves sampling efficiency and model performance in data-driven model discovery.",

The core method involves a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. The main conclusion is that LAM-enabled IBSAs represent a practical path toward building native, safety-critical 6G systems.",

The method involves defining Fγ curves to characterize SDPI for sequential compositions of noisy quantum channels. The results enable tighter finite mixing time bounds and stronger privacy guarantees for sequential private quantum channels.",

This approach overcomes limitations of self-attention-only methods in complex scenes and enables flexible, efficient communication under bandwidth constraints.",
