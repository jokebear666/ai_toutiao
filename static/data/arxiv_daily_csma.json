      "summary": "This paper proposes a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method to optimize cotton irrigation and nitrogen fertilization, using a parent agent for macro-action selection and a child agent incorporating quantified stress factors for daily dynamic control. The method, validated with DSSAT simulations using 2023-2024 field data, achieved increased simulated yield, irrigation water productivity, and nitrogen partial factor productivity compared to baselines. It provides a new approach for improving precision and sustainability in agricultural resource management.",

      "summary": "The paper proposes a framework for AI forensic agents that autonomously orchestrate multiple forensic detectors to verify the authenticity of multimedia content. It argues that a holistic, uncertainty-calibrated approach is necessary to address the challenges posed by generative AI, moving beyond isolated, single-purpose detectors. The main conclusion is that such explainable, uncertainty-aware agents can improve the trustworthiness and interpretability of the forensic verification process.",

It demonstrates that this approach offers advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences compared to RLHF and NLHF. Experiments on large language models show that SLHF achieves strong alignment and enables inference-time refinements that transfer across model families.",

It segments training data across multiple models and evaluates performance over self-training iterations. The main conclusion is that increased epistemic diversity mitigates knowledge collapse, but only up to an optimal level, with too few or too many models leading to poor performance.",
