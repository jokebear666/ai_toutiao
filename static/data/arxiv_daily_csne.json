It establishes the first explicit, non-asymptotic query complexities for finding solutions on smooth strongly convex and nonconvex functions. The main conclusion is that the algorithm achieves efficient convergence rates, offering new insight into why rank-based heuristics are effective for zeroth-order optimization.",

The method demonstrates swift adaptation to environmental shifts and emergent population dynamics in reinforcement learning benchmarks, supporting the idea that evolvability can emerge from neural self-reference.",

It establishes a universal representation property for a class of spike train functions, with quantitative and near-optimal bounds on the required neurons and weights. The main conclusion is that SNNs are particularly well-suited for representing functions with few inputs, low temporal complexity, or compositions thereof, providing a foundation for understanding spike-based neuromorphic systems.",

Despite promising training results, the system suffered catastrophic live performance losses due to overfitting, survivor bias, and microstructure friction. The main conclusion is that increasing model complexity without true information asymmetry leads to systemic fragility in adaptive markets.",
