Demonstrates through numerical evaluation that the derived policy is effective across multiple frequency bands and remains robust under user mobility patterns that deviate from the training model.",
      "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of maintaining high data-rate connectivity for mobile users (e.g., vehicles) across multiple cmWave and mmWave frequency bands. It proposes a joint spectrum mobility and beamforming management framework, formulating the problem as a POMDP and solving it with the PBVI algorithm to find an optimal policy for frequency and beam selection. Numerical results show the policy is effective and robust, even when actual user mobility differs from the model used during policy generation.",
