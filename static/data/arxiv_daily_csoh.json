      "contributions": "1. Creation of the S-BLE dataset, a real-world participatory sensory dataset for BIBO system research. 2. Deployment of a data collection system involving 28 participants and 20 instrumented shuttle buses in a campus setting. 3. Collection of multi-modal data including BLE RSSI, GPS odometry, and smartphone inertial sensor data during regular transit routines.",
      "summary": "This paper introduces the S-BLE dataset, designed to support the development of robust Be-In-Be-Out (BIBO) systems for public transit. The dataset was collected using smartphones from 28 participants and BLE beacons on 20 campus shuttle buses, recording RSSI, GPS, and inertial data during real rides. The work provides a valuable real-world resource for testing and improving implicit ticketing and passenger detection algorithms.",
