      "contributions": "1. Proposes the LEFT-RS protocol, a lock-free design that allows concurrent read access to global resources and parallel entry into critical sections, improving efficiency. 2. Enhances fault resilience by limiting overhead and enabling tasks to complete earlier if others experience faults, reducing blocking. 3. Provides a comprehensive worst-case response time analysis to ensure timing guarantees for the proposed protocol.",
      "summary": "The paper proposes LEFT-RS, a lock-free and fault-tolerant resource sharing protocol for multicore real-time systems. It allows tasks to concurrently access resources and enter critical sections in parallel, improving efficiency and resilience to transient faults. Evaluation shows it significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an 84.5% average improvement in schedulability.",

      "contributions": "1. A lightweight, ephemeral malware detonation sandbox packaged entirely inside a Docker container, integrating QEMU with hardware acceleration and a browser-based workflow. 2. A Universal Entrypoint that performs runtime host-architecture detection and selects validated hypervisor configurations, enabling a single container to launch Windows guests on both ARM64 and x86_64 hosts. 3. Validation of the system on Apple Silicon (ARM64) and Ubuntu (AMD64), demonstrating interactive performance suitable for analyst workflows and consistent teardown via ephemeral container lifecycles.",
      "summary": "This paper presents pokiSEC, a containerized sandbox for dynamic malware analysis that packages QEMU and a browser interface into a Docker container to improve portability and automation. Its key innovation is a Universal Entrypoint that detects the host architecture and configures the hypervisor accordingly, allowing the same container to run on both ARM64 and x86_64 systems. The system was validated on Apple Silicon and Ubuntu, showing it provides interactive performance and clean isolation through ephemeral containers.",
