      "summary": "This paper addresses the problem of UAV water quality monitoring being hindered by dynamic illumination disturbances like shadows and sun glint, which degrade spectral data. The proposed method actively plans safe flight paths by modeling disturbances as obstacles, using an improved IFDS and MPC for real-time trajectory optimization, and dynamically adjusting altitude to improve data quality. Simulation results show the method achieves a 98% obstacle avoidance success rate and increases effective observation data volume by approximately 27%.",
