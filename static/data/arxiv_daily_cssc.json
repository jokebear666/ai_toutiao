      "contributions": "1. Proposes Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP), a lightweight prompting framework that introduces typed variables and deterministic condition evaluators for structured reasoning., 2. Incorporates a rule-based validator to produce traceable and repeatable outputs, enhancing auditability., 3. Demonstrates significant performance gains over standard prompting methods (zero-shot, chain-of-thought, concise) on pharmacologic logic-compliance tasks across multiple open-weight LLMs.",
      "summary": "The paper addresses the unreliability of LLMs on tasks requiring strict rule adherence and determinism. It proposes Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP), a framework using typed variables and rule-based validation to produce traceable outputs. Evaluations on clinical tasks show LSP significantly outperforms standard prompting methods in accuracy and F1 score, making it suitable for safety-critical systems.",

Introduces Temporal Posterior Inference (TPI), a new framework unifying probabilistic programming with temporal logic to compute posterior distributions over execution traces satisfying omega-regular properties. 2. Develops a novel method for computing rigorous upper and lower bounds on satisfaction probabilities by decomposing Rabin acceptance conditions and constructing sound stochastic barrier certificates. 3. Implements the approach in a prototype tool named TPInfer and demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency on a suite of benchmarks.",

TPI computes posterior distributions over program traces that satisfy omega-regular temporal specifications, using a method based on stochastic barrier certificates to provide quantitative verification bounds. The approach is implemented in the TPInfer tool and shown to be effective for inference over rich temporal properties.",
