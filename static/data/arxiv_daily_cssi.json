      "contributions": "1. Investigates and quantifies the relationship between network clustering and the requirements for observability and controllability in scale-free networks., 2. Demonstrates through simulations that densely clustered networks require fewer driver and observer nodes, offering a structural optimization principle., 3. Provides practical insights for reducing sensor/actuator placement in resource-constrained applications like social networks and intelligent transportation systems.",
      "summary": "This paper studies how clustering affects the observability and controllability of complex scale-free networks. Using structured systems theory and Monte-Carlo simulations, it shows that higher clustering reduces the number of required driver and observer nodes. The findings suggest that network design can be optimized for control and monitoring by increasing clustering, especially in resource-limited scenarios.",
